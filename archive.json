Happy to change that.\r\n\r\n    describing this as layering seems wrong\r\n\r\n    kema-CompositeKEM and the other ASN.1 structures seem very\r\n    complex and overly-generic\r\n    [[MO]] It's really just machinery to make the ASN.1 module shorter. Without it, the module would be many hundreds of lines longer. We can unroll it if that's the will of the WG.\r\n\r\n    PUBLIC-KEYS in table 1 refers to signatures, I didn't get\r\n    why?\r\n    [[MO]] copy&paste error. Thanks.\r\n\r\n    section 7.2 (\"OR\" modes) seems odd\r\n    [[MO]] OR modes are now covered by draft-pala-klaussner-composite-kofn; that section should have been removed.\r\n\r\n    appendix C confused me: this I-D has no IPR declaration\r\n    but states that an IPR declaration \"relates\" to this\r\n    draft\r\n    [[MO]] There's IPR on draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs, which probably applies to all three drafts.\r\n",

This is important to resolve ambiguity on, for example, whether the RSA should have a NULL param, and the ECC curve params.\r\n\r\nExample, for id-MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 the ML-DSA SPKI would have an AlgorithmIdentifier of:\r\n\r\n   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        id-ml-dsa\r\n    }\r\nwhich is:\r\n\r\nAlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        {\r\n     1.3.6.1.4.1.2.267.12.4.4\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\nAnd the ECDSA-P256-SHA256 would have a SPKI would have an AlgorithmIdentifier of:\r\n\r\n   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        id-ecPublicKey,\r\n       secp256r1  \r\n  }\r\nwhich is:\r\n\r\n   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        {\r\n     iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) keyType(2) 1 },\r\n       iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) curves(3) prime(1) 7}\r\nAnd the signature algorithm for id-MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256, the first component signature algorithm would have an AlgorithmIdentifier of\r\n\r\n   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        id-ml-dsa\r\n    }\r\nwhich is:\r\n\r\nAlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n        {\r\n     1.3.6.1.4.1.2.267.12.4.4\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\nand the second component signature algorithm would have an AlgorithmIdentifier of\r\n\r\n   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n          ecdsa-with-SHA256\r\n  }\r\nwhich is:\r\n\r\nAlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {\r\n           {\r\n     iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) ansi-X9-62(10045) signatures(4) ecdsa-with-SHA2(3) 2\r\n       }\r\n  }\r\nWith that done, we should replace the message prefix values in Sectien 2.4 with the SHA256 hash of the signature AlgorithmIdentifiers.

This means that it cannot mitigate ML-KEM implementation vulnerabilities.  If decapsulation fails to perform the ciphertext check properly, for example, then it's trivial to find ML-KEM second pre-images and break the IND-CCA2 security of X-Wing.  This isn't an issue if your goal is only to mitigate algorithmic vulnerabilities, but you need to be explicit about that.  At the very least, you need to reconsider \"we also cannot immediately place complete trust in post-quantum replacements until they have undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing to uncover and rectify potential implementation flaws\" in the introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe either need to add Security Consideration text to this effect, or strengthen the combiner.

The text does not state which AlgorithmIDs should be placed in the component OneAsymmetricKeys. Thanks for pointing this out. I don't have an opinion yet, but I'll add it to the list to think about. I have added #72 and https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/55 to track this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, there is an incomprehensible note in your proposal:\r\n\r\nSounds like you comprehended it just fine :)\r\n\r\nThe intention is exactly what you figured out: we are putting `PrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey` inside another OneAsymmetricKey.

The pre-quantum security is therefore reduced to a Diffie-Hellman intractability notion and C2PRI for the KEM.\n\nI think, it is not relevant if RSA-OAEP is C2PRI for your ML-KEM + RSA-OAEP composites, as this is not the security property that RSA-OAEP is asked to deliver in this construction. It is rather that one has to argue that the IND-CCA2-security of the ML-KEM + RSA-OAEP composites (where the RSA-OAEP ciphertext is fed to the combiner) reduce to the IND-CCA2-security of RSA-OAEP and C2PRI of ML-KEM. I guess in that light you are getting closer to a construction given in the paper \"KEM Combiners\" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/024), i.e. one might rather argue along their arguments that one can drop the ciphertext of a C2PRI KEM.",

We're going to put them in one email just\r\nbecause we have comments on quite a few of them.\r\n\r\nISSUE #1\r\n(Github issue:  https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/9)\r\n\r\nASN.1 wrapping confuses people. This came up in the hash-based signatures\r\nupdates last call. Nobody knows what ASN.1 is, or what the consequences\r\nof omiting it are (to be clear, there are really none).\r\n\r\nWe agree that this is largely a question of people being unfamiliar with\r\nASN.1, and that explanatory text is sufficient. All that is needed is a\r\nclear explanation of example what the BIT STRING is, and explaining that\r\nit's simply the bits of the key itself seems pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\nOne can then say something similar to: \r\n\r\n\"In some situations and protocols, the key might be wrapped in ASN.1 or \r\nmay have some other additional decoration or encoding. If so, such wrapping \r\nMUST be removed prior to encoding the key itself as a BIT STRING.\"\r\n\r\nHopefully that makes things crystal clear.\r\n\r\nISSUE #2\r\n(Github Issue: https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/19)\r\n\r\nWe don't think it's worth the extra complexity and expense of an additional\r\nhash operation just to achieve a fixed size output. The variation in size\r\nis already pretty small.\r\n\r\nISSUE #3\r\n(Github issue: https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/6)\r\n\r\nAgain, we don't believe the additional complexity is worth it for a pretty\r\ntrivial improvement in the private key size. But it's not a strong opinion,\r\nwe could go either way.\r\n\r\nOpen Issues affect both Composite Signatures and Composite KEM:\r\nISSUE #4\r\n\r\nChair hat off, I and the CA team are concerned about the slow progress of \r\nthe composite signature work. In particular, tying it to the Composite KEM\r\ndraft and waiting for the CFRG work on KEM Combiners seems like an\r\nabsolutely horrible idea to us. We would like to see Composite Signatures\r\nprogress ASAP.\r\n\r\nISSUE #5\r\n(Github issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-kem/issues/37\r\nhttps://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/24\r\nhttps://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/23)\r\n\r\nThis is a fun one, and we've spent quite a bit of time discussing it\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we're still debating the question about exactly how many\r\nbackwards compatibility options are really necessary. For example, given\r\nthat you already need to add lattice, is it really necessary to allow\r\nPKCS15 to continue to exist? For RSA, there's the reasonable argument that\r\nthat might be all you have in your validated hardware/software, but if you\r\nhave RSA as a primitive, can't you do PSS instead of PKCS15? Remember, you\r\nalready have to make changes on both the signing and verify side anyway.\r\n\r\nWe're trending in the direction of thinking that the primary decision is\r\nthe security level and post-quantum algorithm, and the classical side is\r\njust determined by what \"makes sense\" for that security level and algorithm.\r\n\r\nSo what you really want is something like \"id-SL1-MLKEM-RSA\" where the\r\ndocument specifies exactly what \"RSA\" means in the context of a SL1 MLKEM512\r\ncomposite, e.g. RSA4096-PSS-SHA512. This basically means striving for\r\nat most one combination for each triple of (security level, PQC flavor, classical \r\nflavor) and eliminating unnecessary complexity and diversity of options in what \r\nis essentially a redundancy/backup mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to more aggressively standardize the backwards \r\ncompatibility options to only what's actually necessary, instead of\r\ntrying to be backwards compatible with the universe of current behavior,\r\nwhich both unnecessarily complicates things, and preserves some practices\r\n(e.g. PKCS15) longer than is perhaps prudent.\r\n\r\n-Tim\r\n",

This is no longer a concern with FIPS 203 / 204, so we could now remove it. However, I think it will be a fair amount of editorial work (we will need to accurately list out the bit position to split at for each composite alg), and it is asking all existing composite implementations to change, then will require a lot of interop testing. Is this change really worth it?\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly about this, then perhaps you could prepare the change to the document on a side-branch, and we could bring it to the LAMPS mailing list?\r\n",

We now use either `HKDF-SHA256/256` or `SHA3-256` for the internal KEM combiner KDF -- note that there is no cryptographic reason why we need HKDF-SHA3 because a single iteration of SHA3 by already has the necessary DualPRF properties (but SHA2 does not, hence needing the HMAC / HKDF wrapper).\r\n\r\nFor the KDF used as the CMS KEMRecipientInfo layer we need a proper KDF, not for security property reasons, but because it needs to be variable-length output, so here we use either HKDF-SHA2 or KMAC.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease see the updated version here (which will be posted to IETF Datatracker on Oct 21). Please let me know if this is still unclear.

This has a number of problems, including:\r\n\r\n(1) There seems to be no analysis suggesting the stripped down version satisfies the necessary properties of a KEM. For example, what are the binding properties of this variant, and do they vary based on the traditional KEM that's used? DHKEM, in comparison, is known to satisfy the IND-CCA2 requirement (when instantiated correctly) and its binding properties are known. \r\n(2) More importantly, when trying to use the composite KEM in HPKE, things become super awkward. Let's take a concrete example. Let's say I want to use composite ML-KEM with P-256 in HPKE. Part of doing that requires one to implement `DeriveKeyPair`, as per RFC9180. However, as the document is currently written, there is no deterministic key generation function on the KEM interface, i.e., one can't simply call `(tradPK, tradSK) = TradKEM.MissingDeterministicKeyGenerationFunction(tradSeed)`. This means we need to either expand the KEM interface in this document, which would mean that there would be two different deterministic key generation functions for P-256, one defined here and one defined in RFC9180, or we can simply use RFC9180's function directly. The former seems quite redundant and undesirable, whereas the latter isn't exactly possible. Recall that we're trying to use ML-KEM with P-256, not ML-KEM with DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256). \r\n\r\nThese problems vanish if we insist that elliptic-curve-based KEMs must be DHKEM as specified in RFC9180. Then we have a very clean path towards integration into HPKE without compromising on any features.",

For example, are we going to end up with layers upon layers of labels, most of which end up getting instantiated with the empty string?\r\n\r\nIf this ends up imposing a bunch of extra complexity on PKI implementers in order to make things easier for HPKE implementers, then I will likely vote No, but I'll keep an open mind until I fully understand what you're proposing.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeyGen\r\n----\r\n\r\nDeirdre also brought up issues with composite KeyGen -- and this is currently what's keeping X-Wing as a separate algorithm, rather than folding it into Composite -- part of the design goal of composite is that for the extremely change-controlled environments, it allows you to start rolling out PQ even if you only currently have RSA- or ECDH-capable hardware. Consider for example this migration scenario, which is one of our primary design goals:\r\n\r\nAll your employees' corporate ID badges double as smartcards to insert into your laptop for Windows login and email decryption.\r\nYou want emails to start being composite-encrypted tomorrow, so you push a patch that will generate a new RSA key on the smartcard, and an ML-KEM key stored in Windows CAPI, and you get a cert for that as a composite. All your over-the-wire emails are now PQ-protected, you can still claim that the whole thing is FIPS-certified because of the RSA smartcards, and you didn't have to replace any hardware (yet).\r\nAs you start getting your hands on FIPS-certified ML-KEM smartcards and issuing them to employees, you can either do the composite in the smartcard if it supports it, or ML-KEM in smartcard and RSA in software, or pure ML-KEM; it's nice and flexible and you get all the benefits of hybrid regardless of which half is in hardware and FIPS-certified.\r\n\r\nMy concern about making this draft overly prescriptive about KeyGen is that we'll lose this flexibility and acceleration of being able to leverage composite to get FIPS-certified ML-KEM hybrids into production before you have a FIPS-certified ML-KEM.",

Expand the input keying material\r\n    expanded = SHAKE256(message=ikm, outlen=Nsk)\r\n\r\n  3. Derive component keys\r\n    (mlkemPK, mlkemSK) = ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal(expanded[0:32], expanded[32:64])\r\n    (tradPK, tradSK)   = Trad.KeyGen(expanded[64:])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a few problems with this:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nThat is explicitly disallowed by FIPS 203 -- it is very clear that the ML-KEM seed must be DIRECT output of an approved DRBG. If you do this, then you'll have something that walks&talks like ML-KEM, but it cannot be FIPS-certified as ML-KEM.\r\n\r\nHPKE is not my protocol, not my users, not my customers, so I don't officially have an opinion, but it seems wrong to claim that there are zero HPKE implementers in the world who care about having a FIPS-certified implementation of HKPE. Certainly in the PKI / LAMPS world we all care very much about national crypto standards (NIST, BSI, etc), so something that explicitly violates FIPS 203 cannot be in this draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n```\r\n(tradPK, tradSK)   = Trad.KeyGen(expanded[64:])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that that's elegant for X25519, but I have never seen a P256 or RSA API that takes a seed. Forcing people to write new wrappers for their Trad component (which would force the code to go through FIPS evaluation again) is antithetical to the design goal of this draft; we want to use the Trad component in a completely black-box way.\r\n\r\nAlso, I imagine that the way this would have to work for RSA is that you use the seed `expanded[64:]` to seed your SecureRandom object, and then call RSA.keygen() with that SecureRandom instance. That means that the RSA key that you get will depend both on the seed value and on which SecureRandom implementation you use, so this is still under-specified if the goal is to have deterministic keygen from that seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for both reasons, I thoroughly disagree with defining a 1-seed 2-priv-keys KeyGen() in this draft. That's X-Wing. That is in fact the only difference between Composite and X-Wing. It sounds like you actually want to be collaborating on draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem because that shares your design goal.",

SerializePublicKey and DeserializePublicKey\n\nEach component KEM public key is serialized according to its\n   respective standard as shown in Appendix B and concatenated together\n   using a fixed 4-byte length field denoting the length in bytes of the\n   first component key, as defined below.\nIn the case of DHKEM, serialization and deserialization of the public keys is performed according to the Section 7.1.1 [RFC9180], which is repeated here for convenience.\nFor P-256 and P-384 the SerializePublicKey() function of the KEM performs the uncompressed Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String conversion according to [[SECG](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#SECG)]. DeserializePublicKey() performs the uncompressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point conversion.\nFor X25519 and X448, the SerializePublicKey() and DeserializePublicKey() functions are the identity function, since these curves already use fixed-length byte strings for public keys.\n\nIn the case of ML-KEM the SerializePublicKey() and DeserializePublicKey() functions are the identity function, since according to the Section 3 [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] ML-KEM-PublicKey is coded as OCTED STRING so no additional encoding of the ML-KEM public key value is applied.\n\nIn the case of RSA-OAEP tbd.\n\nJustification: you need to indicate how the conversion is performed.  \n\n10.\tSection 4.4\n>  3.

The only difference is that pk is the private key, and the\n>   output is the concatenation of the mlkem and traditional private keys\n>   for serialization, or the mlkem and traditional private keys for\n>   deserialization.\n\nIn the case of DHKEM, serialization and deserialization of the private keys is performed according to the Section 7.1.2 [RFC9180], which is repeated here for convenience.\nFor P-256 and P-384, the SerializePrivateKey() function of the KEM performs the Field-Element-to-Octet-String conversion according to [SECG]. If the private key is an integer outside the range [0, order-1], where order is the order of the curve being used, the private key MUST be reduced to its representative in [0, order-1] before being serialized. DeserializePrivateKey() performs the Octet-String-to-Field-Element conversion according to [SECG].\nFor X25519 and X448, private keys are identical to their byte string representation, so little processing has to be done. The SerializePrivateKey() function MUST clamp its output and the DeserializePrivateKey() function MUST clamp its input, where clamping refers to the bitwise operations performed on k in the decodeScalar25519() and decodeScalar448() functions defined in Section 5 of [RFC7748].\n\nIn the case of ML-KEM the SerializePrivateKey() and DeserializePrivateKey() functions are the identity function, since according to the Section 3 [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] ML-KEM-PrivateKey is coded as OCTED STRING so no additional encoding of the ML-KEM private key value is applied.\n\nIn the case of RSA-OAEP tbd.\n\nExcept for the above the same serialization and deserialization process as described in Section 4.4 should be used to serialize and deserialize the private keys.\n\n14.\tSection 4.6\n>  4.6.  SerializeCiphertextValue and DeSerializeCiphertextValue\n>\n>   Each Ciphertext component of CompositeCiphertextValue is serialized\n>   according to their respective standard as shown in Appendix B and\n>   concatenated together using a fixed 4-byte length field denoting the\n>   length in bytes of the first component signature, as shown below.\n>   For the Traditional component, the CipherText is the encrypted value\n>   'enc' as described in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 depending on the\n>   chosen component algorithm.\n>\n> Composite-ML-DSA.SerializeCiphertextValue(CompositeCiphertextValue) ->\n> bytes\n>\n> Explicit Input:\n>\n>  CompositeCiphertextValue    The Composite CipherText Value obtained from Composite-ML-KEM.Encap(pk)\n\n4.6.  SerializeCipherTextValue and DeSerializeCipherTextValue\n\nThe ML-KEM ciphertext, as well as the RSA-OAEP algorithm ciphertext are encoded as OCTET STRING hence no serialization (conversion to byte string) is needed and formally we use the identity function for serialization and deserialization. However, the DHKEM algorithm ciphertext (Section 3.2) is the sender's ephemeral public key, encoded as BIT STRING in the case of ECDH hence it must be serialized according to the Section 4.4. Note a raw Edwards public key according to [RFC8410] contains the byte stream so serialization is not needed in that case and formally we use the identity function for serialization and deserialization X25519 and X448 public key (see Section 4.4).  \n\nTaking the above into account each Ciphertext component of CompositeCiphertTextValue is serialized according to their respective standard as shown in Appendix B and concatenated together using a fixed 4-byte length field denoting the length in bytes of the first component signature, as shown below.\nFor the Traditional component, the CipherText is the encrypted value 'enc' as described in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 depending on the chosen component algorithm.\n\nComposite-ML-KEM.SerializeCipherTextValue(CompositeCipherTextValue) -> bytes\n\nExplicit Input:\n\n  CompositeCipherTextValue    The Composite CipherText Value obtained from Composite-ML-KEM.Encap(pk)\n\nJustification: clarification of serialization aspects and replacement of DSA with KEM.\n  \n15.\tSection 4.6\n>  Serialization Process:\n>\n>  1.

Since the latest version of the document has changed the SEQUENCE of two elements to a concatenation of two byte elements, adding the length in bytes of the first element (related to the ML-KEM algorithm), it seems that such a \"serialized\" form will be used in other ASN structures, e.g. in X.509 certificates. However, in this chapter, e.g. CompositeKEMPublicKey appears, which element has not appeared anywhere before. Wouldn't it be more reasonable to introduce CompositeSerializeKEMPublicKey, which would be defined as an OCTET STRING, but without additional conversions when used in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.subjectPublicKey field, similarly to [draft-kyber-certificates]?",

In the future, it might be simpler for both of us if you submitted pull requests rather than long comments like this.\n\n\nI see.\n\nI am hoping that we don't need to get into the detail of how each component algorithm serializes itself, but I understand your comment now and I will think about it. Certainly we do not want to require a single encoding of an underlying component that might cause compatibility issues with some existing traditional implementations. The authors have discussed this recently and we have cleaned up some text around that in a different pull request.",

          "body": "@PiotrPopis \n\nDiscussed with authors ... we have made a few decisions on how to handle encodings of the underlying traditional components:\n\n1. We should directly reference only RFCs for the underlying components, and only indirectly reference the [SEC#] standards.\n1. Any RSA or ECC encoding that is allowed by a PKIX RFC should still be allowed in composite, but we should RECOMMEND the most common one. In effect, we decided that one of the primary design goals of composite is to be a stepping-stone to deploy ML-DSA / ML-KEM quickly on top of existing RSA or ECC deployments, and so it is unacceptable to have, for example, an embedded RSA implementation that cannot be changed that produces private keys in the CRT format, and you cannot use this with Composite. (Note: one exception to this is RSA-PKCS#1v1.5 encryption which we know is still very common, but is already disallowed by NIST). To this effect, we are ok to leave in the risk of two composite implementations being incompatible because they cannot parse each other's traditional component.\n\nWe have changes to make his clearer another PR #137 for KEMs and https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/pull/154 for SIGS, and those links to other github issues with the relevant discussion.\n\n\nHere is the proposed new text that we feel strikes the right balance between being clear and precise, but also still allowing any existing encoding to continue being used.\n\nhttps://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-kem/pull/137/files#diff-7b3ea5108ab106290ae79a3c40838aba0cf1228868deb9863aabd5b3acab21eeR722\n\nSo my question is: while this is different than what you propose, can you live with this?",

(\u2026) _To this effect, we are ok to leave in the risk of two composite implementations being incompatible because they cannot parse each other's traditional component._ \nIt seems that these new provisions regarding encodings of the underlying components are precise enough that the risk of lack of interoperability is at an acceptably low level. \n\n4. I understand that references to Appendix B have been abandoned in the context of specifying serialization (version 06, e.g. the first sentence in chapter 4.4 _Each component KEM public key is serialized according to its respective standard as shown in Appendix B_ (...)), \nwhich is a good solution in my opinion; and now serialization (conversion to byte form) is left without indicating specific functions (e.g. chapter 7.1 RFC 9180), and only the method of encoding keys and ciphertext is specified quite precisely.\n\n5. If I understand this new approach correctly, then - for example - when we use RSA as a traditional component and according to CompositeKEMPublicKey {#sec-composite-pub-keys} Section: \n      CompositeKEMPublicKey ::= BIT STRING \nIn the X.509 certificate, in the SubjectPublicKeyInfo field (encoded as BIT STRING) we place the concatenation: the ML-KEM public key saved as a **byte stream** and the RSA public key as a **bit stream**. \nIf the above is OK, maybe such an example should be added to the document?\n",

I have tried to provide some kind of coherent explanation in the very next section \"## Rationale for choices\", so let me know if that doesn't make sense, but the truth is that I can't really defend the choices beyond that I'm trying to balance about 15 conflicting opinions on the mailing list, and while I'm never going to make everyone happy, this set seems to be some kind of global minimum in how much I get yelled at.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main things I'm trying to align against are:\r\n\r\n1. X-Wing (draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem-04) uses SHA3-256, so our id-MLKEM768-X25519 should do the same.\r\n2. openpgp uses SHA3-256 for all combinations -- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc-04#name-key-combiner -- Russ has been adamant that these two drafts align as much as possible.\r\n3. Some people want SHA2 combinations, so I somewhat arbitrarily decided to make the ML-KEM768's (except X-Wing) use SHA2, and the ML-KEM1024's use SHA3. This is supposed to be some kind of compromise instead of just 2x\u2019ing the list to provide every combination with both SHA2 and SHA3.\r\n\r\nI guess the test will be if anyone says that the NEED ML-KEM1024 with SHA2, in which case I'll have to ask the LAMPS mailing list whether Objective 2 should be completely thrown out the window in order to satisfy Objective 3, or if I should just 2x the list.",

It looks like you are okay with that Chris which is great.    So Chris I'll use what you did in Composite KEM as a kind of template to update composite signatures, and then maybe add some tweaks into your branch (fully remove ASN.1) before final merging.

To elaborate, the HPKE `DeriveKeyPair` function takes a seed as input. The specification of `DeriveKeyPair` currently expands that seed into two components -- one for each component KEM. The first piece goes to `ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal`, and the second piece goes to the traditional KEM's `DeriveKeyPair` function. Currently, the PR uses SHAKE256 as the XOF to do this expansion, exactly as X-Wing does. But if we believe the premise that SHA3 will _not_ be available in all environments, we might want to do something else.\r\n\r\n(To be clear, I don't think it's reasonable to believe that SHA-3 implementations will _not_ be available. This is new code, after all, and new code could just as well add SHA-3 if it's not available.)\r\n\r\nIn any case, could you please have a look and let me know what you think? This is the final piece of the puzzle before we can get some actual HPKE code points!",

          "body": "Hi Chris.   Thanks for the update.   I'm okay with these changes except that I noticed you switched the prototype OIDs back to ending with .21 ... .29...    Those were from the previous version and won't be compatible with this update since we removed the ASN.1 sequence wrappings (so this upcoming -06 version will not be binary compatible with the last version).   So if you could update the OIDs to use .30 to .39 then we wouldn't cause prototype interoperability issues.   Eventually we will get official OIDs from IANA, but for people wanting to interoperate now we use these prototype OIDS.   I'm ok with adding the MLKEM768-ECDH-P256 one as well.  So re-numbering the OIDs starting at 30 makes sense.  For example:\r\n\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.30 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-RSA2048\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.31 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-RSA3072\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.32 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-RSA4096\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.33 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-X25519\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.34 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-ECDH-P256\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.35 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-ECDH-P384\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.36 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM768-ECDH-brainpoolP256r1\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.37 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM1024-ECDH-P384\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.38 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM1024-ECDH-brainpoolP384r1\r\n2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.39 \u00a0 entrust-Algorithm-ExplicitComposite-KEM.id-MLKEM1024-X448\r\n\r\nThat would also mean you need to update the DER Encoded OID table again.
