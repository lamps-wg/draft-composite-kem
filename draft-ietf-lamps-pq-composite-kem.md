--- abstract

This document defines combinations of ML-KEM [FIPS.203] in hybrid with traditional algorithms RSA-OAEP, ECDH, X25519, and X448. These combinations are tailored to meet security best practices and regulatory requirements. Composite ML-KEM is applicable in any application that uses X.509 or PKIX data structures that accept ML-KEM, but where the operator wants extra protection against breaks or catastrophic bugs in ML-KEM.

# Changes in version -07

Interop-affecting changes:

* ML-KEM secret keys are now only seeds.
* Since all ML-KEM keys and ciphertexts are now fixed-length, dropped the length-tagged encoding.
* Added complete test vectors.
* Added ML-KEM1024+ECDH-P521 combination.
* Updated prototype OIDs so these don't conflict with the previous versions
* Removed the "Use in CMS" section so that we can get this document across the finish line, and defer CMS-related debates to a separate document.

Editorial changes:

* Since we are only using the first step of HKDF, which is HKDF-Extract() and not HKDF-Expand(), it was decided that it's clearer to systematically rename this to "HMAC Combiner".
* Added an informative section on the difference between SHA3 and HMAC-SHA2 combiners, and the difference between HKDF(), HKDF-Extract(), and HMAC().
* Since the serialization is now non-DER, drastically reduced the ASN.1-based text.
* Changed `HKDF-SHA384` to `HKDF-SHA512`. Since SHA-384 is a truncated version of SHA-512, and we are further truncating it to 256 bits, these are binary-compatible, might as well list the parent algorithm for clarity.

Still to do in a future version:

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic systems. Traditional cryptographic key establishment algorithms such as RSA-OAEP and ECDH are vulnerable to quantum attacks. During the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the robustness of both existing and new cryptographic algorithms. While we can no longer fully trust traditional cryptography, we also cannot immediately place complete trust in post-quantum replacements until they have undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing to uncover and rectify potential implementation flaws.

Unlike previous migrations between cryptographic algorithms, the decision of when to migrate and which algorithms to adopt is far from straightforward. Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to incorporate multiple public-key algorithms to enhance security.

Cautious implementers may opt to combine cryptographic algorithms in such a way that an attacker would need to break all of them simultaneously to compromise the protected data. These mechanisms are referred to as Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrids {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

Certain jurisdictions are already recommending or mandating that PQC lattice schemes be used exclusively within a PQ/T hybrid framework. The use of Composite scheme provides a straightforward implementation of hybrid solutions compatible with (and advocated by) some governments and cybersecurity agencies [BSI2021].

In addition, [BSI2021] specifically references the composite specification as a concrete example of hybrid X.509 certificates.

A more recent example is [ANSSI2024], a document co-authored by French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI),
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Netherlands National Communications Security Agency (NLNCSA), and
Swedish National Communications Security Authority, Swedish Armed Forces which makes the following statement:

> “In light of the urgent need to stop relying only on quantum-vulnerable public-key cryptography for key establishment, the clear priority should therefore be the migration to post-quantum cryptography in hybrid solutions”

This specification represents the straightforward implementation of the hybrid solutions called for by European cyber security agencies.

PQ/T Hybrid cryptography can, in general, provide solutions to two migration problems:

- Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary has compromised.
- Ease-of-migration: During the transition period, systems will require mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

This document defines a specific instantiation of the PQ/T Hybrid paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) key and ciphertext such that they can be treated as a single atomic algorithm at the protocol level. Composite algorithms address algorithm strength uncertainty because the composite algorithm remains strong so long as one of its components remains strong. Concrete instantiations of composite ML-KEM algorithms are provided based on ML-KEM, RSA-OAEP and ECDH. Backwards compatibility is not directly covered in this document, but is the subject of {{sec-backwards-compat}}.

Composite ML-KEM is intended for general applicability anywhere that key establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX protocols.




## Conventions and Terminology {#sec-terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14+}

This document is consistent with all terminology from {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.
In addition, the following terms are used in this document:

**ALGORITHM**:
          The usage of the term "algorithm" within this
          document generally refers to any function which
          has a registered Object Identifier (OID) for
          use within an ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier. This
          loosely, but not precisely, aligns with the
          definitions of "cryptographic algorithm" and
          "cryptographic scheme" given in {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

**COMBINER:**
  A combiner specifies how multiple shared secrets are combined into
  a single shared secret.

**DER:**
  Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

**KEM:**
   A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in {{sec-kems}}.

**PKI:**
  Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in {{RFC5280}}.

**SHARED SECRET KEY:**
  A value established between two communicating parties for use as
  cryptographic key material suitable for direct use by symmetric
  cryptographic algorithms. This document is concerned with shared
  secrets established via public key cryptographic operations.



Notation:
The algorithm descriptions use python-like syntax. The following symbols deserve special mention:

 * `||` represents concatenation of two byte arrays.

 * `[:]` represents byte array slicing.

 * `(a, b)` represents a pair of values `a` and `b`. Typically this indicates that a function returns multiple values; the exact conveyance mechanism -- tuple, struct, output parameters, etc -- is left to the implementer.

 * `(a, _)`: represents a pair of values where one -- the second one in this case -- is ignored.


## Composite Design Philosophy

{{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}} defines composites as:

>   *Composite Cryptographic Element*:  A cryptographic element that
>      incorporates multiple component cryptographic elements of the same
>      type in a multi-algorithm scheme.

Composite keys, as defined here, follow this definition and should be regarded as a single key that performs a single cryptographic operation such as key generation, signing, verifying, encapsulating, or decapsulating -- using its internal sequence of component keys as if they form a single key. This generally means that the complexity of combining algorithms can and should be handled by the cryptographic library or cryptographic module, and the single composite public key, private key, ciphertext and signature can be carried in existing fields in protocols such as PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}}, CMP {{RFC4210}}, X.509 {{RFC5280}}, CMS {{RFC5652}}, and the Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914]. In this way, composites achieve "protocol backwards-compatibility" in that they will drop cleanly into any protocol that accepts an analogous single-algorithm cryptographic scheme without requiring any modification of the protocol to handle multiple algorithms.



# Overview of the Composite ML-KEM Scheme {#sec-kems}

We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) from {{I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design}}, in which a KEM is a cryptographic primitive that consists of three algorithms:

   *  `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)`: A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key `pk` and a secret key `sk`.

  * `KeyGen(seed) -> (pk, sk)`: A deterministic key generation algorithm
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk from a seed.

   *  `Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)`: A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key `pk` and outputs a ciphertext `ct`
      and shared secret ss. Note: this document uses `Encap()` to conform to {{?RFC9180}},
      but [FIPS.203] uses `Encaps()`.

   *  `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss`: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key `sk` and ciphertext `ct` and outputs a shared
      secret `ss`, or in some cases a distinguished error value.
      Note: this document uses `Decap()` to conform to {{RFC9180}},
      but [FIPS.203] uses `Decaps()`.


We define the following algorithms which are used to serialize and deserialize component values. These algorithms are inspired by similar algorithms in {{RFC9180}}.


   * `SerializePublicKey(mlkemPK, tradPK) -> bytes`: Produce a byte string encoding the component public keys.

   * `DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> (mlkemPK, tradPK)`: Parse a byte string to recover the component public keys.

   * `SerializeCiphertext(mlkemCT, tradCT) -> bytes`: Produce a byte string encoding the component ciphertexts.

   * `DeserializeCiphertext(bytes) -> (mlkemCT, tradCT)`: Parse a byte string to recover the component ciphertexts.

   * `SerializePrivateKey(mlkemSeed, tradSK) -> bytes`: Produce a byte string encoding the component private keys.

   * `DeserializePrivateKey(bytes) -> (mlkemSeed, tradSK)`: Parse a byte string to recover the component private keys.

Full definitions of serialization and deserialization algorithms can be found in {{sec-serialization}}.

The KEM interface defined above differs from both traditional key transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo defined in {{RFC5652}}), and key agreement (for example for use with KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in {{RFC5652}}).

The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key establishment because it allows for arbitrary combinations of component algorithm types since both key transport and key agreement mechanisms can be promoted into KEMs as described in {{sec-RSAOAEPKEM}} and {{sec-DHKEM}} below.

This specification uses the Post-Quantum KEM ML-KEM as specified in [FIPS.203] and {{I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}}. For Traditional KEMs, this document uses the RSA-OAEP algorithm defined in [RFC8017], the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement schemes ECDH defined in section 5.7.1.2 of [SP.800-56Ar3], and X25519 / X448 which are defined in [RFC8410]. A combiner function is used to combine the two component shared secrets into a single shared secret.


## Promotion of RSA-OAEP into a KEM {#sec-RSAOAEPKEM}

The RSA Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), as defined in section 7.1 of [RFC8017] is a public key encryption algorithm used to transport key material from a sender to a receiver. It is promoted into a KEM by having the sender generate a random 256 bit secret and encrypt it.

Note that, at least at the time of writing, the algorithm `RSAOAEPKEM` is not defined as a standalone algorithm within PKIX standards and it does not have an assigned algorithm OID, so it cannot be used directly with CMS KEMRecipientInfo [RFC9629]; it is merely a building block for the composite algorithm.

~~~
RSAOAEPKEM.Encap(pkR):
  shared_secret = SecureRandom(ss_len)
  enc = RSAES-OAEP-ENCRYPT(pkR, shared_secret)

  return shared_secret, enc
~~~

Note that the OAEP label `L` is left to its default value, which is the empty string as per [RFC8017]. The shared secret output by the overall Composite ML-KEM already binds a composite domain separator, so there is no need to also utilize the component domain separators.

The value of `ss_len` as well as the RSA-OAEP parameters used within this specification can be found in {{sect-rsaoaep-params}}.

 `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` is accomplished in the analogous way.

~~~
RSAOAEPKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
  shared_secret = RSAES-OAEP-DECRYPT(skR, enc)

  return shared_secret
~~~


## Promotion of ECDH into a KEM {#sec-DHKEM}

An elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement is promoted into a KEM `Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)` using a simplified version of the DHKEM definition from [RFC9180]; simplified to remove the context-binding labels since the shared secret output by the overall Composite ML-KEM already binds a composite domain separator, so there is no need to also utilize labels within DHKEM.

Note that, at least at the time of writing, the algorithm `DHKEM` is not defined as a standalone algorithm within PKIX standards and it does not have an assigned algorithm OID, so it cannot be used directly with CMS KEMRecipientInfo [RFC9629]; it is merely a building block for the composite algorithm.

~~~
DHKEM.Encap(pkR):
  skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
  shared_secret = DH(skE, pkR)
  enc = SerializePublicKey(pkE)

  return shared_secret, enc
~~~

`Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` is accomplished in the analogous way.

~~~
DHKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
  pkE = DeserializePublicKey(enc)
  shared_secret = DH(skR, pkE)

  return shared_secret
~~~

This construction applies for all variants of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman used in this specification: ECDH, X25519, and X448.

The simplifications from the DHKEM definition in [RFC9180] is that since the ciphertext and receiver's public key are included explicitly in the Composite ML-KEM combiner, there is no need to construct the `kem_context` object, and since a domain separator is included explicitly in the Composite ML-KEM combiner there is no need to perform the labeled steps of `ExtractAndExpand()`.

Note that here, `SerializePublicKey()` and `DeserializePublicKey()` refer to the underlying encoding of the DH primitive, and not to the composite serialization functions defined in {{sec-serialization}}.



# Composite ML-KEM Functions {#sec-composite-mlkem}

This section describes the composite ML-KEM functions needed to instantiate the public KEM API in {{sec-kems}}.

## Key Generation

In order to maintain security properties of the composite, applications that use composite keys MUST always perform fresh key generations of both component keys and MUST NOT reuse existing key material. See {{sec-cons-key-reuse}} for a discussion.

To generate a new keypair for Composite schemes, the `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)` function is used. The KeyGen() function calls the two key generation functions of the component algorithms independently. Multi-process or multi-threaded applications might choose to execute the key generation functions in parallel for better key generation performance.

The following describes how to instantiate a `KeyGen()` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID.KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)

Explicit Inputs:
     None

Implicit Inputs mapped from <OID>:

  ML-KEM     The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
             parameter set, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad       The underlying traditional algorithm and
             parameter, for example "RSA-OAEP"
             or "X25519".

Output:
  (pk, sk)  The composite keypair.

Key Generation Process:

  1. Generate component keys

    mlkemSeed = Random(32)
    (mlkemPK, _) = ML-KEM.KeyGen(mlkemSeed)
    (tradPK, tradSK) = Trad.KeyGen()

  2. Check for component key gen failure
    if NOT (mlkemPK, mlkemSK) or NOT (tradPK, tradSK):
      output "Key generation error"

  3. Output the composite public and private keys

    pk = SerializePublicKey(mlkemPK, tradPK)
    sk = SerializePrivateKey(mlkemSK, tradSK)
    return (pk, sk)

In order to ensure fresh keys, the key generation functions MUST be executed for both component algorithms. Compliant parties MUST NOT use or import component keys that are used in other contexts, combinations, or by themselves as keys for standalone algorithm use.

Note that in step 2 above, both component key generation processes are invoked, and no indication is given about which one failed. This SHOULD be done in a timing-invariant way to prevent side-channel attackers from learning which component algorithm failed.

## Encapsulation

The `Encap(pk)` of a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is designed to behave exactly the same as `ML-KEM.Encaps(ek)` defined in Algorithm 20 in Section 7.2 of [FIPS.203]. Specifically, `Composite-ML-KEM.Encap(pk)` produces a 256-bit shared secret key that can be used directly with any symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm. In this way, Composite ML-KEM can be used as a direct drop-in replacement anywhere that ML-KEM is used.

The following describes how to instantiate a `Encap(pk)` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)

Explicit Input:

  pk          Composite public key consisting of encryption public keys
              for each component.

Implicit inputs mapped from <OID>:

  ML-KEM   The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set, for example "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

  KDF      The KDF specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm.
           See algorithm specifications below.

  Domain   Domain separator value for binding the ciphertext to the
           Composite OID. See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:

  ss      The shared secret key, a 256-bit key suitable for use with
          symmetric cryptographic algorithms.

  ct      The ciphertext, a byte string.

Encap Process:

  1. Separate the public keys.

      (mlkemPK, tradPK) = DeserializePublicKey(pk)

  2.  Perform the respective component Encap operations according to
      their algorithm specifications.

      (mlkemCT, mlkemSS) = ML-KEM.Encaps(mlkemPK)
      (tradCT, tradSS) = TradKEM.Encap(tradPK)

  3. If either ML-KEM.Encaps() or TradKEM.Encap() return an error,
     then this process must return an error.

      if NOT (mlkemCT, mlkemSS) or NOT (tradCT, tradSS):
        output "Encapsulation error"

  4. Encode the ciphertext

      ct = SerializeCiphertext(mlkemCT, tradCT)

  5. Combine the KEM secrets and additional context to yield the
     composite shared secret

        ss = KemCombiner(mlkemSS, tradSS, tradCT, tradPK, Domain)

  6. Output composite shared secret key and ciphertext

     return (ss, ct)
~~~

The specific values for `KDF` are defined per Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{tab-kem-algs}} and the specific values for `Domain` are defined per Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{sec-alg-ids}}.

## Decapsulation {#sect-composite-decaps}

The `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` of a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is designed to behave exactly the same as `ML-KEM.Decaps(dk, c)` defined in Algorithm 21 in Section 7.3 of [FIPS.203]. Specifically, `Composite-ML-KEM.Decap(sk, ct)` produces a 256-bit shared secret key that can be used directly with any symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm. In this way, Composite ML-KEM can be used as a direct drop-in replacement anywhere that ML-KEM is used.

The following describes how to instantiate a `Decap(sk, ct)` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.Decap(sk, ct) -> ss

Explicit inputs

  sk    Composite private key consisting of decryption private keys for
        each component.

  ct      The ciphertext, a byte string.

Implicit inputs mapped from <OID>:

  ML-KEM   The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     The underlying traditional algorithm and
           parameter set, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

  KDF      The KDF specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm.
           See algorithm specifications below.

  Domain   Domain separator value for binding the ciphertext to the
           Composite OID. See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:

  ss      The shared secret key, a 256-bit key suitable for use with
          symmetric cryptographic algorithms.

Decap Process:

  1. Separate the private keys

      (mlkemSK, tradSK) = DeserializePrivateKey(sk)

  2. Parse the ciphertext

      (mlkemCT, tradCT) = DeserializeCiphertext(ct)

  3.  Perform the respective component Encap operations according to
      their algorithm specifications.

      mlkemSS = MLKEM.Decaps(mlkemSK, mlkemCT)
      (_, tradSS)  = TradKEM.Decap(tradSK, tradCT)

  4. If either ML-KEM.Decaps() or TradKEM.Decap() return an error,
     then this process must return an error.

      if NOT mlkemSS or NOT tradSS:
        output "Encapsulation error"

  5. Combine the KEM secrets and additional context to yield the composite shared secret

      ss = KemCombiner(mlkemSS, tradSS, tradCT, tradPK, Domain)

  6. Output composite shared secret key

     return ss
~~~
{: #alg-composite-mlkem-decap title="Composite-ML-KEM.Decap(sk, ct)"}

It is possible to use component private keys stored in separate software or hardware keystores. Variations in the process to accommodate particular private key storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document so long as it produces the same output and error handling as the process sketched above.

In order to properly achieve its security properties, the KEM combiner requires that all inputs are fixed-length. Since each Composite ML-KEM algorithm fully specifies its component algorithms, including key sizes, all inputs should be fixed-length in non-error scenarios, however some implementations may need to perform additional checking to handle certain error conditions. In particular, the KEM combiner step should not be performed if either of the component decapsulations returned an error condition indicating malformed inputs. For timing-invariance reasons, it is RECOMMENDED to perform both decapsulation operations and check for errors afterwards to prevent an attacker from using a timing channel to tell which component failed decapsulation. Also, RSA-based composites MUST ensure that the modulus size (i.e. the size of tradCT and tradPK) matches that specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{tab-kem-algs}}; depending on the cryptographic library used, this check may be done by the library or may require an explicit check as part of the `CompositeKEM.Decap()` routine.


## KEM Combiner Function {#sec-kem-combiner}

As noted in the Encapsulation and Decapsulation proceedures above, this specification defines two
KEM combiner constructions, one with SHA3 and one with HMAC-SHA2.

The following describes how to instantiate a `KemCombiner(..)` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.KemCombiner(mlkemSS, tradSS, tradCT, tradPK, Domain) -> ss

Explicit inputs:

  The list of input values to be combined.

Implicit inputs mapped from <OID>:

  KDF      The KDF specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm.
           In particular, for the KEM combiner it only matters
           whether this as a SHA3 function, which can be used
           as a KDF directly, or a SHA2 function which requires
           an HMAC construction.

Output:

  ss      The shared secret key, a 256-bit key suitable for use with
          symmetric cryptographic algorithms.


Process:

  if KDF is "SHA3-256":
    ss = SHA3-256(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)

  else if KDF is "HMAC-{Hash}":

    ss = HMAC-{Hash}(salt={0}, IKM=mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT
                                           || tradPK || Domain)
    ss = truncate(ss, 256)
        # Where "{0}" is the string of HashLen zeros according to
        # section 2.2 of [RFC5869].

        # Where "{Hash} is the underlying hash function used
        # for the given composite algorithm.

        # Since Composite KEM always outputs a 256-bit shared secret,
        # the output is always truncated to 256 bits, regardless
        # of underlying hash function.

  return ss
~~~

Implementation note: The HMAC-based combiner here is exactly the "HKDF-Extract" step from [RFC5869] with an empty `salt`. Implementations with access to "HKDF-Extract", without the "HKDF-Expand" step, MAY use this interchangeably with the HMAC-based construction presented above. Note that a full invocation of HKDF with both HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand, even with the correct output length and empty `info` param is not equivalent to the HMAC construction above since HKDF-Expand will always perform at least one extra iteration of HMAC.


# Serialization {#sec-serialization}

This section presents routines for serializing and deserializing composite public keys, private keys (seeds), and ciphertext values to bytes via simple concatenation of the underlying encodings of the component algorithms.
The functions defined in this section are considered internal implementation detail and are referenced from within the public API definitions in {{sec-composite-mlkem}}}.

Deserialization is possible because ML-KEM has fixed-length public keys, private keys (seeds), and ciphertext values as shown in the following table.

| Algorithm   | Public Key  | Private Key |  Ciphertext  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
| ML-KEM-768  |    1184     |     64      |     1088     |
| ML-KEM-1024 |    1568     |     64      |     1568     |
{: #tab-mlkem-sizes title="ML-KEM Key and Ciphertext Sizes"}

When these values are required to be carried in an ASN.1 structure, they are wrapped as described in {{sec-encoding-to-der}}.

While ML-KEM has a single fixed-size representation for each of public key, private key, and ciphertext, the traditional component might allow multiple valid encodings; for example an elliptic curve public key, and therefore also ciphertext, might be validly encoded as either compressed or uncompressed [SEC1], or an RSA private key could be encoded in Chinese Remainder Theorem form [RFC8017]. In order to obtain interoperability, composite algorithms MUST use the following encodings of the underlying components:

* **ML-KEM**: MUST be encoded as specified in [FIPS.203], using a 64-byte seed as the private key.
* **RSA**: MUST be encoded with the `(n,e)` public key representation as specified in A.1.1 of [RFC8017] and the private key representation as specified in A.1.2 of [RFC8017].
* **ECDH**: public key MUST be encoded as an `ECPoint` as specified in section 2.2 of [RFC5480], with both compressed and uncompressed keys supported. For maximum interoperability, it is RECOMMENEDED to use uncompressed points.
* **X25519 and X448**: MUST be encoded as per section 5 of [RFC7748].

In the event that a composite implementation uses an underlying implementation of the traditional component that requires a different encoding, it is the responsibility of the composite implementation to perform the necessary transcoding. Even with fixed encodings for the traditional component, there may be slight differences in encoded size of the traditional component due to, for example, encoding rules that drop leading zeroes. See {{sec-sizetable}} for further discussion of encoded size of each composite algorithm.



## SerializePublicKey and DeserializePublicKey {#sec-serialize-deserialize}

The serialization routine for keys simply concatenates the fixed-length public keys of the component algorithms, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializePublicKey(mlkemPK, tradPK) -> bytes

Explicit inputs:

  mlkemPK  The ML-KEM public key, which is bytes.

  tradPK   The traditional public key in the appropriate
           bytes-like encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Implicit inputs:

  None

Output:

  bytes   The encoded composite public key


Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded public key

     output mlkemPK || tradPK

~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize title="SerializePublicKey(mlkemPK, tradPK) -> bytes"}

Deserialization reverses this process.
key is deserialized according to their respective standard as shown in {{appdx_components}}.

The following describes how to instantiate a `DeserializePublicKey(bytes)` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> (mlkemPK, tradPK)

Explicit inputs:

  bytes   An encoded public key

Implicit inputs mapped from <OID>:

  ML-KEM   The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

Output:

  mlkemPK  The ML-KEM public key, which is bytes.

  tradPK   The traditional public key in the appropriate
           bytes-like encoding for the underlying component algorithm.


Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded public key.
       The length of the mlkemPK is known based on the size of
       the ML-KEM component key length specified by the Object ID

     switch ML-KEM do
        case ML-KEM-768:
          mlkemPK = bytes[:1184]
          tradPK  = bytes[1184:]
        case ML-KEM-1024:
          mlkemPK = bytes[:1568]
          tradPK  = bytes[1568:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length keys, RSA and ECDH
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking
     of the overall composite key is not always possible.

  2. Output the component public keys

     output (mlkemPK, tradPK)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-pk title="DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> (mlkemPK, tradPK)"}




## SerializePrivateKey and DeserializePrivateKey {#sec-serialize-privkey}

The serialization routine for keys simply concatenates the fixed-length private keys of the component algorithms, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializePrivateKey(mlkemSeed, tradSK) -> bytes

Explicit inputs:

  mlkemSeed  The ML-KEM private key, which is the bytes of the seed.

  tradSK     The traditional private key in the appropriate
             encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Implicit inputs:

  None

Output:

  bytes   The encoded composite private key

Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded private key

     output mlkemSeed || tradSK
~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize-priv-key title="SerializePrivateKey(mlkemSeed, tradSK) -> bytes"}


Deserialization reverses this process.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.DeserializePrivateKey(bytes) -> (mlkemSeed, tradSK)

Explicit inputs:

  bytes   An encoded composite private key

Implicit inputs:

  That an ML-KEM private key is 64 bytes for all parameter sets.

Output:

  mlkemSeed  The ML-KEM private key, which is the bytes of the seed.

  tradSK    The traditional private key in the appropriate
             encoding for the underlying component algorithm.


Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded key.
       The length of an ML-KEM private key is always a 64 byte seed
       for all parameter sets.

      mlkemSeed = bytes[:64]
      tradSK  = bytes[64:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length keys (seeds), RSA and ECDH
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking
     of the overall composite key is not always possible.

  2. Output the component private keys

     output (mlkemSeed, tradSK)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-priv-key title="DeserializeKey(bytes) -> (mlkemSeed, tradSK)"}




## SerializeCiphertext and DeserializeCiphertext

The serialization routine for the CompositeCiphertextValue simply concatenates the fixed-length
ML-KEM ciphertext with the ciphertext from the traditional algorithm, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializeCiphertext(mlkemCT, tradCT) -> bytes

Explicit inputs:

  mlkemCT  The ML-KEM ciphertext, which is bytes.

  tradCT   The traditional ciphertext in the appropriate
           encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Implicit inputs:

  None

Output:

  bytes   The encoded CompositeCiphertextValue


Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded composite ciphertext

     output mlkemCT || tradCT

~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize-ct title="SerializeCiphertext(mlkemCT, tradCT) -> bytes"}


Deserialization reverses this process.


The following describes how to instantiate a `DeserializeCiphertext(bytes)` function for a given composite algorithm reperesented by `<OID>`.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM<OID>.DeserializeCiphertext(bytes) -> (mldkemCT, tradCT)

Explicit inputs:

  bytes   An encoded CompositeCiphertextValue

Implicit inputs mapped from <OID>:

  ML-KEM   The underlying ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

Output:

  mlkemCT  The ML-KEM ciphertext, which is bytes.

  tradCT   The traditional ciphertext in the appropriate
           encoding for the underlying component algorithm.


Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded ciphertext.
       The length of the mlkemCT is known based on the size of
       the ML-KEM component ciphertext length specified by the Object ID

     switch ML-KEM do
        case ML-KEM-768:
          mlkemCT = bytes[:1088]
          tradCT  = bytes[1088:]
        case ML-KEM-1024:
          mlkemCT= bytes[:1568]
          tradCT  = bytes[1568:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length ciphertexts, RSA and ECDH
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking is
     not always possible here.

  2. Output the component ciphertext values

     output (mlkemCT, tradCT)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-ct title="DeserializeCiphertext(bytes) -> (mldkemCT, tradCT)"}




# Use within X.509 and PKIX

The following sections provide processing logic and the necessary ASN.1 modules necessary to use composite ML-KEM within X.509 and PKIX protocols.

While composite ML-KEM keys and ciphertexts MAY be used raw, the following sections provide conventions for using them within X.509 and other PKIX protocols, including defining ASN.1-based wrappers for the binary composite values, such that these structures can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing public key and ciphertext fields such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652].


## Encoding to DER {#sec-encoding-to-der}

The serialization routines presented in {{sec-serialization}} produce raw binary values. When these values are required to be carried within a DER-encoded message format such as an X.509's `subjectPublicKey BIT STRING` [RFC5280] or a CMS `KEMRecipientInfo.kemct OCTET STRING` [RFC9629], then the composite value MUST be wrapped into a DER BIT STRING or OCTET STRING in the obvious ways:

When an OCTET STRING is required, the DER encoding of the composite data value SHALL be used directly.

When a BIT STRING is required, the octets of the composite data value SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string, with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.


## Key Usage Bits

When any Composite ML-KEM `AlgorithmIdentifier` appears in the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` field of an X.509 certificate [RFC5280], the key usage certificate extension MUST only contain

~~~
keyEncipherment
~~~

Composite ML-KEM keys MUST NOT be used in a "dual usage" mode because even if the
traditional component key supports both signing and encryption,
the post-quantum algorithms do not and therefore the overall composite algorithm does not.


## ASN.1 Definitions {#sec-asn1-defs}

The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is defined to allow for compact definitions of each composite algorithm, leading to a smaller overall ASN.1 module.

~~~ ASN.1
pk-CompositeKEM {OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id}
  PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
    IDENTIFIER id
    KEY BIT STRING
    PARAMS ARE absent
    CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
  }
~~~
{: artwork-name="CompositeKeyObject-asn.1-structures"}


The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found in the ASN.1 Module in {{sec-asn1-module}}.


The ASN.1 algorithm object for a Composite ML-KEM is:

~~~
kema-CompositeKEM {
  OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
    PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
    KEM-ALGORITHM ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id
         VALUE OCTET STRING
         PARAMS ARE absent
         PUBLIC-KEYS { publicKeyType }
        }
~~~

Use cases that require an interoperable encoding for composite private keys will often need to place a composite private key inside a `OneAsymmetricKey` structure defined in [RFC5958], such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12 [RFC7292], CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211]. The definition of `OneAsymmetricKey` is copied here for convenience:

~~~ ASN.1
 OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version                   Version,
       privateKeyAlgorithm       PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
       privateKey                PrivateKey,
       attributes            [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
       ...,
       [[2: publicKey        [1] PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
       ...
     }

  ...
  PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
                        -- Content varies based on type of key.  The
                        -- algorithm identifier dictates the format of
                        -- the key.
~~~
{: artwork-name="RFC5958-OneAsymmetricKey-asn.1-structure"}

When a composite private key is conveyed inside a OneAsymmetricKey structure (version 1 of which is also known as PrivateKeyInfo) [RFC5958], the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set to the corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according to {{sec-alg-ids}} and its parameters field MUST be absent.  The `privateKey` field SHALL contain the OCTET STRING representation of the serialized composite private key as per {{sec-serialize-privkey}}. The `publicKey` field remains OPTIONAL.

Some applications may need to reconstruct the `OneAsymmetricKey` objects corresponding to each component private key. {{sec-alg-ids}} and {{appdx_components}} provide the necessary mapping between composite and their component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.

Component keys of a composite private key MUST NOT be used in any other type of key or as a standalone key. For more details on the security considerations around key reuse, see {{sec-cons-key-reuse}}.

Note that in alignment with ML-KEM, Composite KEM algorithms output a 256-bit shared secret key at all security levels.

As the number of algorithms can be daunting to implementers, see {{sec-impl-profile}} for a discussion of choosing a subset to support.

Full specifications for the referenced component algorithms can be found in {{appdx_components}}.


## Domain Separators {#sec-domsep-values}

The KEM combiner used in this document requires a domain separator `Domain` input.  The following table shows the HEX-encoded domain separator for each Composite ML-KEM AlgorithmID; to use it, the value MUST be HEX-decoded and used in binary form. The domain separator is simply the DER encoding of the composite algorithm OID.

## Rationale for choices

In generating the list of Composite algorithms, the following general guidance was used, however, during development of this specification several algorithms were added by direct request even though they do not fit this guidance.

* Pair equivalent security levels between component algorithms.
* NIST-P-384 is CNSA approved [CNSA2.0] for all classification levels.

A single invocation of SHA3 is known to behave as a dual-PRF, and thus is sufficient for use as a KDF, see {{sec-cons-kem-combiner}}, however SHA2 is not so must be wrapped in the HMAC construction.

Composite algorithms that use either RSA or ECDH as the traditional component are paired with HMAC-SHA2 as the KDF in order to facilitate implementations that do not have easy access to SHA3 outside of the ML-KEM function. Composite algorithms using Edwards curves (X25519 and X448) are paired with SHA3 for computational efficiency and for compatibility with other similar specifications.


While it may seem odd to use 256-bit outputs at all security levels, this aligns with ML-KEM which produces a 256-bit shared secret key at all security levels. SHA-256 and SHA3-256 both have >= 256 bits of (2nd) pre-image resistance, which is the required property for a KDF to provide 128 bits of security, as allowed in Table 3 of {{SP.800-57pt1r5}}. Composite algorithms at higher security levels use a larger hash function in order to preserve internal collision resistance of the hash function at a comparable strength to the underlying component algorithms up to the point where truncation to a 256-bit output is performed.

## RSA-OAEP Parameters {#sect-rsaoaep-params}

Use of RSA-OAEP [RFC8017] within `id-MLKEM768-RSA2048-HMAC-SHA256`, `id-MLKEM768-RSA3072-HMAC-SHA256`, and `id-MLKEM768-RSA4096-HMAC-SHA256` requires additional specification.

First, a quick note on the choice of RSA-OAEP as the supported RSA encryption primitive. RSA-KEM [RFC5990] is more straightforward to work with, but it has fairly limited adoption and therefore is of limited backwards compatibility value. Also, while RSA-PKCS#1v1.5 [RFC8017] is still everywhere, but hard to make secure and no longer FIPS-approved as of the end of 2023 [SP800-131Ar2], so it is of limited forwards value. This leaves RSA-OAEP [RFC8017] as the remaining choice.

The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit and 3072-bit security levels respectively.

As with the other Composite ML-KEM algorithms, when `id-MLKEM768-RSA2048-HMAC-SHA256`, `id-MLKEM768-RSA3072-HMAC-SHA256`, or `id-MLKEM-RSA4096` is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters MUST be absent. The RSA-OAEP SHALL be instantiated with the following hard-coded parameters which are the same for the 2048, 3072 and 4096 bit security levels.

| RSAES-OAEP-params           | Value                       |
| ----------------------      | ---------------             |
| hashAlgorithm               | id-sha256                 |
| maskGenAlgorithm            | mgf1SHA256Identifier        |
| pSourceAlgorithm            | pSpecifiedEmpty             |
| ss_len                      | 256 bits                    |
{: #rsa-oaep-params title="RSA-OAEP Parameters"}

where:

* `id-sha256` is defined in [RFC8017].
* `mgf1SHA256Identifier` is defined in [RFC4055], which refers to the MFG1 function defined in [RFC8017] appendix B.2.1.
* `pSpecifiedEmpty` is defined in [RFC8017] to indicate that the empty string is used for the label.

Note: The mask length, according to [RFC8017], is `k - hLen - 1`, where `k` is the size of the RSA modulus. Since the choice of hash function and the RSA key size is fixed for each composite algorithm, implementations could choose to pre-compute and hard-code the mask length.

# Security Considerations

## Why Hybrids?

In broad terms, a PQ/T Hybrid can be used either to provide dual-algorithm security or to provide migration flexibility. Let's quickly explore both.

Dual-algorithm security. The general idea is that the data is proctected by two algorithms such that an attacker would need to break both in order to compromise the data. As with most of cryptography, this property is easy to state in general terms, but becomes more complicated when expressed in formalisms. The following sections go into more detail here.

Migration flexibility. Some PQ/T hybrids exist to provide a sort of "OR" mode where the client can choose to use one algorithm or the other or both. The intention is that the PQ/T hybrid mechanism builds in backwards compatibility to allow legacy and upgraded clients to co-exist and communicate. The Composites presented in this specification do not provide this since they operate in a strict "AND" mode, but they do provide codebase migration flexibility. Consider that an organization has today a mature, validated, certified, hardened implementation of RSA or ECC. Composites allow them to add to this an ML-KEM implementation which immediately starts providing benefits against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks even if that ML-KEM implemtation is still experimental, non-validated, non-certified, non-hardened implementation. More details of obtaining FIPS certification of a composite algorithm can be found in {{sec-fips}}.

## KEM Combiner {#sec-cons-kem-combiner}

The following KEM combiner construction is as follows is used by both `Composite-ML-KEM.Encap()` and `Composite-ML-KEM.Decap()` and is split out here for easier analysis.

~~~
  KDF(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
~~~
{: #code-generic-kem-combiner title="KEM combiner construction"}

where:

* `KDF(message)` represents a key derivation function suitable to the chosen KEMs according to {{tab-kem-algs}}. All KDFs produce a 256-bit shared secret key, which matches ML-KEM.
* `mlkemSS` is the shared secret key from the ML-KEM component.
* `tradSS` is the shared secret from the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `tradCT` is the ciphertext from the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `tradPK` is the public key of the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `Domain` is the DER encoded value of the object identifier of the Composite ML-KEM algorithm as listed in {{sec-domsep-values}}.
* `||` represents concatenation.

Each registered Composite ML-KEM algorithm specifies the choice of `KDF` and `Domain` to be used in {{sec-alg-ids}} and {{sec-domsep-values}} below. Given that each Composite ML-KEM algorithm fully specifies the component algorithms, including for example the size of the RSA modulus, all inputs to the KEM combiner are fixed-size and thus do not require length-prefixing. The `CompositeKEM.Decap()` specified in {{sect-composite-decaps}} adds further error handling to protect the KEM combiner from malicious inputs.

The primary security property of the KEM combiner is that it preserves IND-CCA2 of the overall Composite ML-KEM so long as at least one component is IND-CCA2 {X-Wing} [GHP18]. Additionally, we also need to consider the case where one of the component algorithms is completely broken; that the private key is known to an attacker, or worse that the public key, private key, and ciphertext are manipulated by the attacker. In this case, we rely on the construction of the KEM combiner to ensure that the value of the other shared secret cannot be leaked or the combined shared secret predicted via manipulation of the broken algorithm. The following sections continue this discussion.

Note that length-tagging of the inputs to the KDF is not required:

* `mlkemSS` is always 32 bytes.
* `tradSS` in the case of ECDH this is derived by the decapsulator and therefore the length is not controlled by the attacker, however in the case of RSA-OAEP this value is directly chosen by the sender and both the length and content could be freely chosen by an attacker.
* `tradCT` is either an elliptic curve public key or an RSA-OAEP ciphertext which is required to have its length checked by step 1b of RSAES-OAEP-DECRYPT in [RFC8017].
* `tradPK` is the public key of the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA) and therefore fixed-length.
* `Domain` is a fixed value specified in this document.

In the case of a composite with ECDH, all inputs to the KDF are fixed-length.
In the case of a composite with RSA-OAEP the `tradSS` is controlled by the attacker but this still does not require length tagging because, unless there is a weakness in the KDF, length-manipulation of only one input is not sufficient to trivially produce collisions.

### Security of the hybrid scheme {#sec-hybrid-security}

Informally, a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is secure if the combiner (HMAC-SHA2 or SHA3) is secure, and either ML-KEM is secure or the traditional component (RSA-OAEP, ECDH, or X25519) is secure.

The security of ML-KEM and ECDH hybrids is covered in [X-Wing] and requires that the first KEM component (ML-KEM in this construction) is IND-CCA and second ciphertext preimage resistant (C2PRI) and that the second traditional component is IND-CCA. This design choice improves performance by not including the large ML-KEM public key and ciphertext, but means that an implementation error in the ML-KEM component that affects the ciphertext check step of the FO transform could result in the overall composite no longer achieving IND-CCA2 security. Note that ciphertext collisions exist in the traditional component by the composite design choice to support any underlying encoding of the traditional component, such as compressed vs uncompressed EC points as the ECDH KEM ciphertext. This solution remains IND-CCA due to binding the `tradPK` and `tradCT` in the KEM combiner.

The QSF framework presented in [X-Wing] is extended to cover RSA-OAEP as the traditional algorithm in place of ECDH by noting that RSA-OAEP is also IND-CCA secure [RFC8017].

Note that X-Wing uses SHA3 as the combiner KDF whereas Composite ML-KEM uses either SHA3 or HMAC-SHA2 which are interchangeable in the X-Wing proof since both behave as random oracles under multiple concatenated inputs.

The Composite combiner cannot be assumed to be secure when used with different KEMs and a more cautious approach would bind the public key and ciphertext of the first KEM as well.


### Second pre-image resistance of component KEMs {#sec-cons-ct-collision}

The notion of a second pre-image resistant KEM is defined in [X-Wing] being the property that it is computationally difficult to find two different ciphertexts `c != c'` that will decapsulate to the same shared secret under the same public key. For the purposes of a hybrid KEM combiner, this property means that given two composite ciphertexts `(c1, c2)` and `(c1', c2')`, we must obtain a unique overall shared secret so long as either `c1 != c1'` or `c2 != c2'` -- i.e. the overall Composite ML-KEM is second pre-image resistant, and therefore secure so long as one of the component KEMs is secure.

In [X-Wing] it is proven that ML-KEM is a second pre-image resistant KEM and therefore the ML-KEM ciphertext can safely be omitted from the KEM combiner. Note that this makes a fundamental assumption on ML-KEM remaining ciphertext second pre-image resistant, and therefore this formulation of KEM combiner does not fully protect against implementation errors in the ML-KEM component -- particularly around the ciphertext check step of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform -- which could trivially lead to second ciphertext pre-image attacks that break the IND-CCA2 security of the ML-KEM component and of the overall Composite ML-KEM. This could be more fully mitigated by binding the ML-KEM ciphertext in the combiner, but a design decision was made to settle for protection against algorithmic attacks and not implementation attacks against ML-KEM in order to increase performance.

However, since neither RSA-OAEP nor ECDH guarantee second pre-image resistance at all, even in a correct implementation, these ciphertexts are bound to the key derivation in order to guarantee that `c != c'` will yield a unique ciphertext, and thus restoring second pre-image resistance to the overall Composite ML-KEM.

### SHA3 vs HMAC-SHA2

In order to achieve the desired security property that the Composite ML-KEM is IND-CCA2 whenever at least one of the component KEMs is, the KDF used in the KEM combiner needs to possess collision and second pre-image resistance with respect to each of its inputs independently; a property sometimes called "dual-PRF" [Aviram22]. Collision and second-pre-image resistance protects against compromise of one component algorithm from resulting in the ability to construct multiple different ciphertexts which result in the same shared secret. Pre-image resistance protects against compromise of one component algorithm being used to attack and learn the value of the other shared secret.

SHA3 is known to have all of the necessary dual-PRF properties [X-Wing], but SHA2 does not and therefore all SHA2-based constructions MUST use SHA2 within an HMAC construction such as HKDF-Extract upon which the composite HMAC combiner is based [GHP18].

### Generifying this construction

It should be clear that the security analysis of the presented KEM combiner construction relies heavily on the specific choices of component algorithms and combiner KDF, and this combiner construction SHOULD NOT by applied to any other combination of ciphers without performing the appropriate security analysis.

## Key Reuse {#sec-cons-key-reuse}

When using single-algorithm cryptography, the best practice is to always generate fresh keying material for each purpose, for example when renewing a certificate, or obtaining both a TLS and S/MIME certificate for the same device, however in practice key reuse in such scenarios is not always catastrophic to security and therefore often tolerated. With composite keys we have a much stricter security requirement. However this reasoning does not hold in the PQ / Traditional hybrid setting.

Within the broader context of PQ / Traditional hybrids, we need to consider new attack surfaces that arise due to the hybrid constructions and did not exist in single-algorithm contexts. One of these is key reuse where the component keys within a hybrid are also used by themselves within a single-algorithm context. For example, it might be tempting for an operator to take already-deployed RSA keys and add an ML-KEM key to them to form a hybrid. Within a hybrid signature context this leads to a class of attacks referred to as "stripping attacks" where one component signature can be extracted and presented as a single-algorithm signature. Hybrid KEMs using a concatenation-style KEM combiner, as is done in this document, do not have the analogous attack surface because even if an attacker is able to extract and decrypt one of the component ciphertexts, this will yield a different shared secret than the overall shared secret derived from the composite, so any subsequent symmetric cryptographic operations will fail. However there is still a risk of key reuse which relates to certificate revocation, as well as general key reuse security issues.

Upon receiving a new certificate enrollment request, many certification authorities will check if the requested public key has been previously revoked due to key compromise. Often a CA will perform this check by using the public key hash. Therefore, even if both components of a composite have been previously revoked, the CA may only check the hash of the combined composite key and not find the revocations. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid key reuse and always generate fresh component keys for a new composite. It is also RECOMMENDED that CAs performing revocation checks on a composite key should also check both component keys independently.


## Decapsulation failure

Provided all inputs are well-formed, the key establishment procedure of ML-KEM will never explicitly fail. Specifically, the ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps algorithms from [FIPS.203] will always output a value with the same data type as a shared secret key, and will never output an error or failure symbol. However, it is possible (though extremely unlikely) that the process will fail in the sense that ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps will produce different outputs, even though both of them are behaving honestly and no adversarial interference is present. In this case, the sender and recipient clearly did not succeed in producing a shared secret key. This event is called a decapsulation failure. Estimates for the decapsulation failure probability (or rate) for each of the ML-KEM parameter sets are provided in Table 1  of [FIPS.203] and reproduced here in {{tab-mlkem-failure-rate}}.


| Parameter set     | Decapsulation failure rate  |
|---------          | -----------------           |
| ML-KEM-512        | 2^(-139)                    |
| ML-KEM-768        | 2^(-164)                    |
| ML-KEM-1024       | 2^(-174)                    |
{: #tab-mlkem-failure-rate title="ML-KEM decapsulation failure rates"}

In the case of ML-KEM decapsulation failure, Composite ML-KEM MUST preserve the same behaviour and return a well-formed output.


## Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

Traditionally, a public key or certificate contains a single cryptographic algorithm. If and when an algorithm becomes deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), the path to deprecating it and removing it from operational environments is, at least is principle, straightforward.

In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use. As such, a single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled independently from that of their component algorithms. For example a cryptographic policy might continue to allow `id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256` even after ECDH-P256 is deprecated.

The Composite ML-KEM design specified in this document, and especially that of the KEM combiner specified in this document, and discussed in {{sec-cons-kem-combiner}}, means that the overall Composite ML-KEM algorithm should be considered to have the security strength of the strongest of its component algorithms; i.e. as long as one component algorithm remains strong, then the overall composite algorithm remains strong.

# Approximate Key and Ciphertext Sizes {#sec-sizetable}

Note that the sizes listed below are approximate: these values are measured from the test vectors, but other implementations could produce values where the traditional component has a different size. For example, this could be due to:

* Compressed vs uncompressed EC point.
* The RSA public key `(n, e)` allows `e` to vary is size between 3 and `n - 1` [RFC8017].
* When the underlying RSA or EC value is itself DER-encoded, integer values could occaisionally be shorter than expected due to leading zeros being dropped from the encoding.

Note that by contrast, ML-KEM values are always fixed size, so composite values can always be correctly de-serialized based on the size of the ML-KEM component.

Implementations MUST NOT perform strict length checking based on the values in this table.

Non-hybrid ML-KEM is included for reference.

# Implementation Considerations {#sec-in-pract}

## FIPS Certification {#sec-fips}

The following sections give guidance to implementers wishing to FIPS-certify a composite implentation.

This guidance is not authoritative and has not been endorsed by NIST.

### Combiner Function

For reference, the KEM Combiner used in Composite KEM is:

~~~
ss = KDF(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
~~~

where KDF is either SHA3 or HMAC-SHA2.


NIST SP 800-227 [SP-800-227ipd], which at the time of writing is in its initial public draft period, allows hybrid key combiners of the following form:

~~~
K ← KDM(S1‖S2‖ · · · ‖St , OtherInput)           (14)
~~~

The key derivation method KDM can take one of two forms, either

~~~
K ← KDF(Z‖OtherInput)                            (12)
~~~

or

~~~
K ← Expand(Extract(salt, Z), OtherInput)         (13)
~~~

In terms of the order of inputs, Composite KEM places the two shared secret keys `mlkemSS || tradSS` at the beginning of the KDF input such that all other inputs `tradCT || tradPK || Domain` can be considered part of `OtherInput` for the purposes of FIPS certification.

For detailed steps [SP-800-227ipd] refers to NIST SP.800-56Cr2 [SP.800-56Cr2]. Compliance of the Composite KEM variants is achieved in the following way:

[SP.800-56Cr2] section 4 "One-Step Key Derivation" requires a `counter` which begins at the 4-byte value 0x00000001. However, the counter is allowed to be omitted when the hash function is executed only once, as specified on page 159 of the FIPS 140-3 Implementation Guidance [FIPS-140-3-IG].

The HMAC-SHA2 options can be certified under [SP.800-56Cr2] One-Step Key Derivation Option 2: `H(x) = HMAC-hash(salt, x)` where `salt` is the empty (0 octet) string, which will internally be mapped to the zero vector `0x00..00` of the correct input size for the underlying hash function in order to satisfy the requirement in [SP.800-56Cr2] that "in the absence of an agreed-upon alternative – the default_salt shall be an all-zero byte string whose bit length equals that specified as the bit length of an input block for the hash function, hash". Note that since the desired shared secret key output length of 256 bits for all security levels aligns with the block size of SHA256 or can be accomplished by truncating SHA-512, we do not need to use the HKDF-Expand step specified in [RFC5869], which further simplifies FIPS certification by allowing us to use the One-Step HMAC-based KDF rather than the Two-Step KDF from [SP.800-56Cr2].

The SHA3 options can be certified under [SP.800-56Cr2] One-Step Key Derivation Option 1: `H(x) = hash(x)`.

### Mixing with Non-Approved Algorithms

[SP-800-227ipd] adds an important stipulation that was not present in earlier NIST specifications:

> This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t > 1, so long as at
> least one shared secret (i.e., S_j for some j) is a shared secret generated from the key-
> establishment methods of SP 800-56A or SP 800-56B, or an approved KEM.

This means that although Composite KEM always places the shared secret key from ML-KEM in the first slot, a Composite KEM can be FIPS certified so long as either component is FIPS certified. This is important for several reasons. First, in the early stages of PQC migration, composites allow for a non-FIPS certified ML-KEM implementation to be added to a module that already has a FIPS certified traditional component, and the resulting composite can be FIPS certified. Second, when eventually RSA and Elliptic Curve are no longer FIPS-allowed, the composite can retain its FIPS certified status on the strength of the ML-KEM component. Third, while this is outside the scope of this document, the general composite construction could be used to create FIPS certified algorithms that contain a component algorithm from a different jurisdiction.


## Backwards Compatibility {#sec-backwards-compat}

As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as providing ease of migration. The composite mechanisms defined in this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be obtained.

The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades. The term "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can inter-operate with the upgraded systems of the future.

These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to key establishment and content encryption, from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME signed email [RFC8551], as well as myriad other standardized and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS [RFC5652] encrypted structures.

## Decapsulation Requires the Public Key {#impl-cons-decaps-pubkey}

ML-KEM always requires the public key in order to perform various steps of the Fujisaki-Okamoto decapsulation [FIPS.203], and for this reason the private key encoding specified in FIPS 203 includes the public key. Moveover, the KEM combiner as specified in {{sec-kem-combiner}} requires the public key of the traditional component in order to achieve the public-key binding property and ciphertext collision resistance as described in {{sec-cons-kem-combiner}}.

The mechanism by which an application transmits the public keys is out of scope of this specification, but it MAY be accomplished by placing a serialized composite public key into the optional `OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey` field of the private key object.

Implementers who choose to use a different private key encoding than the one specified in this document MUST consider how to provide the component public keys to the decapsulate routine. While some implementations might contain routines to computationally derive the public key from the private key, it is not guaranteed that all implementations will support this.



## Profiling down the number of options {#sec-impl-profile}

One immediately daunting aspect of this specification is the number of composite algorithm combinations.
Each option has been specified because there is a community that has a direct application for it; typically because the traditional component is already deployed in a change-managed environment, or because that specific traditional component is required for regulatory reasons.

However, this large number of combinations leads either to fracturing of the ecosystem into non-interoperable sub-groups when different communities choose non-overlapping subsets to support, or on the other hand it leads to spreading development resources too thin when trying to support all options.

This specification does not list any particular composite algorithm as mandatory-to-implement, however organizations that operate within specific application domains are encouraged to define profiles that select a small number of composites appropriate for that application domain.
For applications that do not have any regulatory requirements or legacy implementations to consider, it is RECOMMENDED to focus implemtation effort on:

    id-MLKEM768-X25519-SHA3-256
    id-MLKEM768-ECDH-P256-HMAC-SHA256

In applications that only allow NIST PQC Level 5, it is RECOMMENDED to focus implemtation effort on:

    id-MLKEM1024-ECDH-P384-HMAC-SHA512

# Comparison with other Hybrid KEMs

## X-Wing

This specification borrows extensively from the analysis and KEM combiner construction presented in [X-Wing]. In particular, X-Wing and id-MLKEM768-X25519-SHA3-256 are largely interchangeable. The one difference is that X-Wing uses a combined KeyGen function to generate the two component private keys from the same seed, which gives some additional binding properies. However, using a derived value as the seed for ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal() is, at time of writing, explicitely disallowed by [FIPS.203] which makes it impossible to create a FIPS-compliant implentation of X-Wing KeyGen / private key import. For this reason, this specification keeps the key generatation for both components separate so that implementers are free to use an existing certified hardware or software module for one or both components.

Due to the difference in key generation and security properties, X-Wing and id-MLKEM768-X25519-SHA3-256 have been registered as separate algorithms with separate OIDs, and they use a different domain separator string in order to ensure that their ciphertexts are not inter-compatible.

## ETSI CatKDF

[ETSI.TS.103.744] section 8.2.3 defines CatKDF as:

~~~
1) Form secret = psk || k1 || k 2.
2) Set context = f(info, MA, MB), where f is a context formatting function.
3) key_material = KDF(secret, label, context, length).
4) Return key_material.

MA shall contain all of the public keys.
MB shall contain all of the corresponding public keys and ciphertexts.
~~~

The main difference between the Composite KEM combiner and the ETSI CatKDF combiner is that CatKDF makes the more conservative choice to bind the public keys and ciphertexts of both components, while Composite KEM follows the analysis presented in [X-Wing] that while preserving the security properties of the traditional component requires binding the public key and ciphertext of the traditional component, it is not necessary to do so for ML-KEM thanks to the rejection sampling step of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform.

Additionally, ETSI CatKDF can be instantiated with either HMAC [RFC2104], KMAC [SP.800-185] or HKDF [RFC5869] as KDF. Using HMAC aligns with some of the KDF variants in this specification, but not the ones that use SHA3.


# Test Vectors {#appdx-samples}

The following test vectors are provided in a format similar to the NIST ACVP Known-Answer-Tests (KATs).

The structure is that a global `cacert` is provided which is used to sign each KEM certificate.
Within each test case there are the following values:

* `tcId` the name of the algorithm.
* `ek` the encapsulation public key.
* `x5c` the X.509 certificate of the encapsulation key, signed by the cacert.
* `dk` the raw decapsulation private key.
* `dk_pkcs8` the decapsulation private key in a PKCS#8 object.
* `c` the ciphertext.
* `k` the derived shared secret key.

Implementers should be able to perform the following tests using the test vectors below:

1. Load the public key `ek` or certificate `x5c` and perform an encapsulation for it.
2. Load the decapsulation private key `dk` and the ciphertext `c` and ensure that the same shared secret key `k` can be derived.

Test vectors are provided for each underlying component in isolation for the purposes of debugging.


Due to the length of the test vectors, you may prefer to retrieve them from GitHub. The reference implementation that generated them is also available:
