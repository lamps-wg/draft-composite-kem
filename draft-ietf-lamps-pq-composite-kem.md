--- abstract

This document defines combinations of ML-KEM [FIPS.203] in hybrid with traditional algorithms RSA-OAEP, ECDH, X25519, and X448. These combinations are tailored to meet security best practices and regulatory requirements. Composite ML-KEM is applicable in any application that uses X.509 or PKIX data structures that accept ML-KEM, but where the operator wants extra protection against breaks or catastrophic bugs in ML-KEM.

# Changes in version -07

Interop-affecting changes:

* ML-KEM secret keys are now only seeds.
* Since all ML-KEM keys and ciphertexts are now fixed-length, dropped the length-tagged encoding.
* Added complete test vectors.

Editorial changes:

* Added an informative section on the difference between SHA3 and HKDF-SHA2 combiners, and the difference between HKDF(), HKDF-Extract(), and HMAC().

Still to do in a future version:

- `[ ]` We need PEM samples … hackathon? OQS friends? David @ BC? The right format for samples is probably to follow the hackathon ... a Dilithium or ECDSA trust anchor certificate, a composite KEM end entity certificate, and a CMS EnvelopedData sample encrypted for that composite KEM certificate.
- `[ ]` Other outstanding github issues: https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-kem/issues


# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic systems. Traditional cryptographic algorithms such as RSA-OAEP, ECDH and their elliptic curve variants are vulnerable to quantum attacks. During the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the robustness of both existing and new cryptographic algorithms. While we can no longer fully trust traditional cryptography, we also cannot immediately place complete trust in post-quantum replacements until they have undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing to uncover and rectify potential implementation flaws.

Unlike previous migrations between cryptographic algorithms, the decision of when to migrate and which algorithms to adopt is far from straightforward. Even after the migration period, it may be advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to incorporate multiple public-key algorithms to enhance security.

Cautious implementers may opt to combine cryptographic algorithms in such a way that an attacker would need to break all of them simultaneously to compromise the protected data. These mechanisms are referred to as Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrids {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

Certain jurisdictions are already recommending or mandating that PQC lattice schemes be used exclusively within a PQ/T hybrid framework. The use of Composite scheme provides a straightforward implementation of hybrid solutions compatible with (and advocated by) some governments and cybersecurity agencies [BSI2021].

In addition, [BSI2021] specifically references the composite specification as a concrete example of hybrid X.509 certificates.

A more recent example is [ANSSI2024], a document co-authored by French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI),
Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Netherlands National Communications Security Agency (NLNCSA), and
Swedish National Communications Security Authority, Swedish Armed Forces which makes the following statement:

> “In light of the urgent need to stop relying only on quantum-vulnerable public-key cryptography for key establishment, the clear priority should therefore be the migration to post-quantum cryptography in hybrid solutions”

This specification represents the straightforward implementation of the hybrid solutions called for by European cyber security agencies.

PQ/T Hybrid cryptography can, in general, provide solutions to two migration problems:

- Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy, but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary has compromised.
- Ease-of-migration: During the transition period, systems will require mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully classical to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

This document defines a specific instantiation of the PQ/T Hybrid paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms are combined to form a single key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) key and ciphertext such that they can be treated as a single atomic algorithm at the protocol level. Composite algorithms address algorithm strength uncertainty because the composite algorithm remains strong so long as one of its components remains strong. Concrete instantiations of composite ML-KEM algorithms are provided based on ML-KEM, RSA-OAEP and ECDH. Backwards compatibility is not directly covered in this document, but is the subject of {{sec-backwards-compat}}.

Composite ML-KEM is intended for general applicability anywhere that key establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX protocols.




## Conventions and Terminology {#sec-terminology}

{::boilerplate bcp14+}

This document is consistent with all terminology from {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.
In addition, the following terms are used in this document:

**ALGORITHM**:
          The usage of the term "algorithm" within this
          document generally refers to any function which
          has a registered Object Identifier (OID) for
          use within an ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier. This
          loosely, but not precisely, aligns with the
          definitions of "cryptographic algorithm" and
          "cryptographic scheme" given in {{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}}.

**COMBINER:**
  A combiner specifies how multiple shared secrets are combined into
  a single shared secret.

**KEM:**
   A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in {{sec-kems}}.

**PKI:**
  Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in {{RFC5280}}.

**SHARED SECRET KEY:**
  A value established between two communicating parties for use as
  cryptographic key material suitable for direct use by symmetric
  cryptographic algorithms. This document is concerned with shared
  secrets established via public key cryptographic operations.

## Composite Design Philosophy

{{I-D.ietf-pquip-pqt-hybrid-terminology}} defines composites as:

>   *Composite Cryptographic Element*:  A cryptographic element that
>      incorporates multiple component cryptographic elements of the same
>      type in a multi-algorithm scheme.

Composite keys, as defined here, follow this definition and should be regarded as a single key that performs a single cryptographic operation such as key generation, signing, verifying, encapsulating, or decapsulating -- using its internal sequence of component keys as if they form a single key. This generally means that the complexity of combining algorithms can and should be handled by the cryptographic library or cryptographic module, and the single composite public key, private key, ciphertext and signature can be carried in existing fields in protocols such as PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}}, CMP {{RFC4210}}, X.509 {{RFC5280}}, CMS {{RFC5652}}, and the Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914]. In this way, composites achieve "protocol backwards-compatibility" in that they will drop cleanly into any protocol that accepts an analogous single-algorithm cryptographic scheme without requiring any modification of the protocol to handle multiple algorithms.



# Overview of the Composite ML-KEM Scheme {#sec-kems}

We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) from {{I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design}}, in which a KEM is a cryptographic primitive that consists of three algorithms:

   *  `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)`: A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key `pk` and a secret key `sk`.\

   *  `Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)`: A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key `pk` and outputs a ciphertext `ct`
      and shared secret ss. Note: this document uses `Encap()` to conform to {{?RFC9180}},
      but [FIPS.203] uses `Encaps()`.

   *  `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss`: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key `sk` and ciphertext `ct` and outputs a shared
      secret `ss`, or in some cases a distinguished error value.
      Note: this document uses `Decap()` to conform to {{RFC9180}},
      but [FIPS.203] uses `Decaps()`.

We also borrow the following algorithms from {{RFC9180}}, which deal with encoding and decoding of KEM public key values.

   *  `SerializePublicKey(pk) -> bytes`: Produce a byte string encoding the public key pk.

   *  `DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> pk`: Parse a byte string to recover a public key pk. This function can fail if the input byte string is malformed.

We define the following algorithms which are used to serialize and deseralize the CompositeCiphertextValue

   *  `SerializeCiphertextValue(CompositeCiphertextValue) -> bytes`: Produce a byte string encoding the CompositeCiphertextValue.

   *  `DeserializeCipherTextValue(bytes) -> pk`: Parse a byte string to recover a CompositeCiphertextValue. This function can fail if the input byte string is malformed.

The KEM interface defined above differs from both traditional key transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo defined in {{RFC5652}}), and key agreement (for example for use with KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in {{RFC5652}}).

The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key establishment because it allows for arbitrary combinations of component algorithm types since both key transport and key agreement mechanisms can be promoted into KEMs as described in {{sec-RSAOAEPKEM}} and {{sec-DHKEM}} below.

This specification uses the Post-Quantum KEM ML-KEM as specified in [FIPS.203] and {{I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}}. For Traditional KEMs, this document uses the RSA-OAEP algorithm defined in [RFC8017], the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement schemes ECDH defined in section 5.7.1.2 of [SP.800-56Ar3], and X25519 / X448 which are defined in [RFC8410]. A combiner function is used to combine the two component shared secrets into a single shared secret.


## Promotion of RSA-OAEP into a KEM {#sec-RSAOAEPKEM}

The RSA Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), as defined in section 7.1 of [RFC8017] is a public key encryption algorithm used to transport key material from a sender to a receiver. It is promoted into a KEM by having the sender generate a random 256 bit secret and encrypt it.

Note that, at least at the time of writing, the algorithm `RSAOAEPKEM` is not defined as a standalone algorithm within PKIX standards and it does not have an assigned algorithm OID, so it cannot be used directly with CMS KEMRecipientInfo [RFC9629]; it is merely a building block for the composite algorithm.

~~~
RSAOAEPKEM.Encap(pkR):
  shared_secret = SecureRandom(ss_len)
  enc = RSAES-OAEP-ENCRYPT(pkR, shared_secret)

  return shared_secret, enc
~~~

Note that the OAEP label `L` is left to its default value, which is the empty string as per [RFC8017]. The shared secret output by the overall Composite ML-KEM already binds a composite domain separator, so there is no need to also utilize the component domain separators.

The value of `ss_len` as well as the RSA-OAEP parameters used within this specification can be found in {{sect-rsaoaep-params}}.

 `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` is accomplished in the analogous way.

~~~
RSAOAEPKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
  shared_secret = RSAES-OAEP-DECRYPT(skR, enc)

  return shared_secret
~~~


## Promotion of ECDH into a KEM {#sec-DHKEM}

An elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement is promoted into a KEM `Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)` using a simplified version of the DHKEM definition from [RFC9180]; simplified to remove the context-binding labels since the shared secret output by the overall Composite ML-KEM already binds a composite domain separator, so there is no need to also utilize labels within DHKEM.

Note that, at least at the time of writing, the algorithm `DHKEM` is not defined as a standalone algorithm within PKIX standards and it does not have an assigned algorithm OID, so it cannot be used directly with CMS KEMRecipientInfo [RFC9629]; it is merely a building block for the composite algorithm.

~~~
DHKEM.Encap(pkR):
  skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
  shared_secret = DH(skE, pkR)
  enc = SerializePublicKey(pkE)

  return shared_secret, enc
~~~

`Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` is accomplished in the analogous way.

~~~
DHKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
  pkE = DeserializePublicKey(enc)
  shared_secret = DH(skR, pkE)

  return shared_secret
~~~

This construction applies for all variants of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman used in this specification: ECDH, X25519, and X448.

The simplifications from the DHKEM definition in [RFC9180] is that since the ciphertext and receiver's public key are included explicitly in the Composite ML-KEM combiner, there is no need to construct the `kem_context` object, and since a domain separator is included explicitly in the Composite ML-KEM combiner there is no need to perform the labeled steps of `ExtractAndExpand()`.



# Composite ML-KEM Functions {#sec-composite-mlkem}

This section describes the composite ML-KEM functions needed to instantiate the KEM API in {{sec-kems}}.

## Key Generation

To generate a new keypair for Composite schemes, the `KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)` function is used. The KeyGen() function calls the two key generation functions of the component algorithms for the Composite keypair in no particular order. Multi-process or multi-threaded applications might choose to execute the key generation functions in parallel for better key generation performance.

The following process is used to generate composite keypair values:

~~~
KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)

Explicit Inputs:
     None

Implicit Input:
  ML-KEM     A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
             parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-65".

  Trad       A placeholder for the specific traditional algorithm and
             parameter set to use, for example "RSA-OAEP"
             or "X25519".

Output:
  (pk, sk)  The composite keypair.

Key Generation Process:

  1. Generate component keys

    (mlkemPK, mlkemSK) = ML-KEM.KeyGen()
    (tradPK, tradSK)   = Trad.KeyGen()

  2. Check for component key gen failure
    if NOT (mlkemPK, mlkemSK) or NOT (tradPK, tradSK):
      output "Key generation error"

  3. Output the composite public and private keys

    pk = (mlkemPK, tradPK)
    sk = (mlkemSK, tradSK)
    return (pk, sk)

~~~
{: #alg-composite-keygen title="Composite KeyGen(pk, sk)"}


In order to ensure fresh keys, the key generation functions MUST be executed for both component algorithms. Compliant parties MUST NOT use or import component keys that are used in other contexts, combinations, or by themselves as keys for standalone algorithm use.

Note that in step 2 above, both component key generation processes are invoked, and no indication is given about which one failed. This SHOULD be done in a timing-invariant way to prevent side-channel attackers from learning which component algorithm failed.

## Encapsulation

The `Encap(pk)` of a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is designed to behave exactly the same as `ML-KEM.Encaps(ek)` defined in Algorithm 20 in Section 7.2 of [FIPS.203]. Specifically, `Composite-ML-KEM.Encap(pk)` produces a 256-bit shared secret key that can be used directly with any symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm. In this way, Composite ML-KEM can be used as a direct drop-in replacement anywhere that ML-KEM is used.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.Encap(pk) -> (ss, ct)

Explicit Input:

  pk          Composite public key consisting of encryption public keys
              for each component.

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

  KDF      The KDF specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm.
           See algorithm specifications below.

  Domain   Domain separator value for binding the ciphertext to the
           Composite OID. See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:

  ss      The shared secret key, a 256-bit key suitable for use with
          symmetric cryptographic algorithms.

  ct      The ciphertext, a byte string.

Encap Process:

  1. Separate the public keys.

      (mlkemPK, tradPK) = pk

  2.  Perform the respective component Encap operations according to
      their algorithm specifications.

      (mlkemCT, mlkemSS) = MLKEM.Encaps(mlkemPK)
      (tradCT, tradSS) = TradKEM.Encap(tradPK)

  3. If either ML-KEM.Encaps() or TradKEM.Encap() return an error,
     then this process must return an error.

      if NOT (mlkemCT, mlkemSS) or NOT (tradCT, tradSS):
        output "Encapsulation error"

  4. Encode the ciphertext

      ct = mlkemCT || tradCT

  5. Combine the KEM secrets and additional context to yield the composite shared secret

          # Note: salt is the empty string (0 octets), which will internally be mapped
          # to the zero vector `0x00..00` of the correct input size for the underlying
          # hash function as per [RFC5869].

  6. Output composite shared secret key and ciphertext

     return (ss, ct)

The specific values for `KDF` are defined per Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{tab-kem-algs}} and the specific values for `Domain` are defined per Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{sec-alg-ids}}.

## Decapsulation {#sect-composite-decaps}

The `Decap(sk, ct) -> ss` of a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is designed to behave exactly the same as `ML-KEM.Decaps(dk, c)` defined in Algorithm 21 in Section 7.3 of [FIPS.203]. Specifically, `Composite-ML-KEM.Decap(sk, ct)` produces a 256-bit shared secret key that can be used directly with any symmetric-key cryptographic algorithm. In this way, Composite ML-KEM can be used as a direct drop-in replacement anywhere that ML-KEM is used.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.Decap(sk, ct) -> ss

Explicit Input:

  sk    Composite private key consisting of decryption private keys for
        each component.

  ct      The ciphertext, a byte string.

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     A placeholder for the specific traditional algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

  KDF      The KDF specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm.
           See algorithm specifications below.

  Domain   Domain separator value for binding the ciphertext to the
           Composite OID. See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:

  ss      The shared secret key, a 256-bit key suitable for use with
          symmetric cryptographic algorithms.

Decap Process:

  1. Separate the private keys

      (mlkemSK, tradSK) = sk

  2. Parse the ciphertext

      (mlkemCT, tradCT) = ct

  3.  Perform the respective component Encap operations according to
      their algorithm specifications.

      mlkemSS = MLKEM.Decaps(mlkemSK, mlkemCT)
      tradSS  = TradKEM.Decap(tradSK, tradCT)

  4. If either ML-KEM.Decaps() or TradKEM.Decap() return an error,
     then this process must return an error.

      if NOT mlkemSS or NOT tradSS:
        output "Encapsulation error"

  5. Combine the KEM secrets and additional context to yield the composite shared secret

      if KDF is "SHA3-256"
        ss = SHA3-256(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
      else if KDF is "HKDF"
        ss = HKDF-Extract(salt="", IKM=mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
          # Note: salt is the empty string (0 octets), which will internally be mapped
          # to the zero vector `0x00..00` of the correct input size for the underlying
          # hash function as per [RFC5869].

  6. Output composite shared secret key

     return ss
~~~
{: #alg-composite-mlkem-decap title="Composite-ML-KEM.Decap(sk, ct)"}

It is possible to use component private keys stored in separate software or hardware keystores. Variations in the process to accommodate particular private key storage mechanisms are considered to be conformant to this document so long as it produces the same output and error handling as the process sketched above.

In order to properly achieve its security properties, the KEM combiner requires that all inputs are fixed-length. Since each Composite ML-KEM algorithm fully specifies its component algorithms, including key sizes, all inputs should be fixed-length in non-error scenarios, however some implementations may need to perform additional checking to handle certain error conditions. In particular, the KEM combiner step should not be performed if either of the component decapsulations returned an error condition indicating malformed inputs. For timing-invariance reasons, it is RECOMMENDED to perform both decapsulation operations and check for errors afterwards to prevent an attacker from using a timing channel to tell which component failed decapsulation. Also, RSA-based composites MUST ensure that the modulus size (i.e. the size of tradCT and tradPK) matches that specified for the given Composite ML-KEM algorithm in {{tab-kem-algs}}; depending on the cryptographic library used, this check may be done by the library or may require an explicit check as part of the `CompositeKEM.Decap()` routine.


## KEM Combiner Function

As noted in the Encapsulation and Decapsulation proceedures above, this specification defines two
KEM combiner constructions, one with SHA3 and one with HKDF-SHA2.


```
if KDF is "SHA3-256"
  ss = SHA3-256(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
else if KDF is "HKDF"
  ss = HKDF-Extract(salt="", IKM=mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
    # Note: salt is the empty string (0 octets), which will internally be mapped
    # to the zero vector `0x00..00` of the correct input size for the underlying
    # hash function as per [RFC5869].

```

Implementation note: many cryptographic libraries provide only a combined interface for HKDF and do not
expose HKDF-Extract() and HKDF-Expand() separately.
Note that HKDF() even with the correct output length and empty `info` param is not equivalent to
HKDF-Extract() since an extra iteration of HMAC will be performed.
If HKDF-Extract() is not exposed, then it can be implemented directly with the HMAC primitive as:

```
HKDF-Extract(salt="", IKM=mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
   = HMAC-Hash(salt="", IKM=mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
```


## SerializePublicKey and DeserializePublicKey {#sec-serialize-deserialize}

Each component KEM public key is serialized according to its respective standard as shown in {{appdx_components}} and concatenated together using a fixed 4-byte length field denoting the length in bytes of the first component key, as defined below.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializePublicKey(pk) -> bytes

Explicit Input:

  pk    Composite ML-KEM public key

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     A placeholder for the specific traditional algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

  IntegerToBytes  A function that takes an Integer and converts it to
           a byte representation of size byteLength.  See definition in
           [FIPS.204]

Output:

  bytes   The encoded public key

Serialization Process:

  1. Separate the public keys

     (mlkemPK, tradPK) = pk

  2. Serialize each of the constituent public keys
       The component keys are serialized according to their respective standard
       as shown in the component algorithm appendix.

     mlkemEncodedPK = ML-KEM.SerializePublicKey(mlkemPK)
     tradEncodedPK = Trad.SerializePublicKey(tradPK)

  3. Calculate the length encoding of the mlkemEncodedPK

     If (mlkemEncodedPK.length) > 2^32
         then output "message too long" and stop.

     encodedLength = IntegerToBytes(mlkemEncodedPK.length, 4)

  4. Combine and output the encoded public key

     bytes = encodedLength || mlkemEncodedPK || tradEncodedPK
     output bytes
~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize title="Composite SerializePublicKey(pk)"}

Deserialization reverses this process, raising an error in the event that the input is malformed.  Each component
key is deserialized according to their respective standard as shown in {{appdx_components}}.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> pk

Explicit Input:

  bytes   An encoded public key

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

  Trad     A placeholder for the specific traditional algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example "RSA-OAEP"
           or "X25519".

Output:

  pk     The composite ML-KEM public key

Deserialization Process:

  1. Validate the length of the the input byte string

     if bytes is not the correct length:
      output "Deserialization error"

  2. Parse each constituent encoded public key
       The first 4 bytes encodes the length of mlkemEncodedPK, which MAY
       be used to separate the mlkemEncodedPK and tradEncodedPK, and then
       is to be discarded.  This length SHOULD be checked against the
       expected length value as per ML-KEM.

     (mlkemEncodedPK, tradEncodedPK) = bytes

  3. Deserialize the constituent public keys
        The component keys are deserialized according to their respective standard
        as shown in the component algorithm appendix.

     mlkemPK = ML-KEM.DeserializePublicKey(mlkemEncodedPK)
     tradPK = Trad.DeserializePublicKey(tradEncodedPK)

  4. If either ML-KEM.DeserializePublicKey() or
     Trad.DeserializePublicKey() return an error,
     then this process must return an error.

      if NOT mlkemPK or NOT tradPK:
        output "Deserialization error"

  5. Output the composite ML-KEM public key

     output (mlkemPK, tradPK)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize title="Composite DeserializePublicKey(bytes)"}


## Serialization

This section presents routines for serializing and deserializing composite public keys, private keys (seeds), and ciphertext values to bytes via simple concatenation of the underlying encodings of the component algorithms.
Deserialization is possible because ML-KEM has fixed-length public keys, private keys (seeds), and ciphertext values as shown in the following table.

| Algorithm   | Public key  | Private key |  Ciphertext  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
| ML-KEM-768  |    1184     |     64      |     1088     |
| ML-KEM-1024 |    1568     |     64      |     1568     |
{: #tab-mlkem-sizes title="ML-KEM Key and Ciphertext Sizes"}

When these values are required to be carried in an ASN.1 structure, they are wrapped as described in {{sec-composite-keys}} and {{sec-CompositeCiphertextValue}}.


## SerializePublicKey and DeserializePublicKey

The serialization routine for keys simply concatenates the fixed-length public keys of the component KEM algorithms, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializePublicKey(mlkemKey, tradKey) -> bytes

Explicit Input:

  mlkemKey  The ML-KEM public key, which is bytes.

  tradKey   The traditional public key in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Output:

  bytes   The encoded composite public key

Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded public key

     output mlkemPK || tradPK
~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize-pub-key title="SerializePublicKey(mlkemKey, tradKey) -> bytes"}


Deserialization reverses this process, raising an error in the event that the input is malformed.

~~~
Composite-ML-DSA.DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> (mlkemKey, tradKey)

Explicit Input:

  bytes   An encoded composite public key

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

Output:

  mlkemKey  The ML-DSA public key, which is bytes.

  tradKey   The traditional public key in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded public key.
       The length of the mlkemKey is known based on the size of
       the ML-KEM component key length specified by the Object ID

     switch ML-KEM do
        case ML-KEM-768:
          mlkemKey = bytes[:1184]
          tradKey  = bytes[1184:]
        case MLDSA65:
          mldsaKey = bytes[:1568]
          tradKey  = bytes[1568:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length keys, RSA and ECDH
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking is
     not always possible here.

  2. Output the component public keys

     output (mlkemKey, tradKey)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-pub-key title="DeserializePublicKey(bytes) -> (mlkemKey, tradKey)"}




## SerializePrivateKey and DeserializePrivateKey

The serialization routine for keys simply concatenates the fixed-length private keys of the component signature algorithms, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializePrivateKey(mlkemKey, tradKey) -> bytes

Explicit Input:

  mlkemSeed  The ML-KEM private key, which is the bytes of the seed.

  tradKey   The traditional private key in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Output:

  bytes   The encoded composite private key

Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded private key

     output mlkemSeed || tradKey
~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize-priv-key title="SerializePrivateKey(mlkemSeed, tradKey) -> bytes"}


Deserialization reverses this process, raising an error in the event that the input is malformed.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.DeserializePrivateKey(bytes) -> (mlkemSeed, tradKey)

Explicit Input:

  bytes   An encoded composite private key

Output:

  mldsaSeed  The ML-DSA private key, which is the bytes of the seed.

  tradKey   The traditional private key in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded key.
       The length of an ML-KEM private key is always a 64 byte seed
       for all parameter sets.

      mldsaSeed = bytes[:64]
      tradKey  = bytes[64:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length keys (seeds), RSA and ECDSA
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking is
     not always possible here.

  2. Output the component private keys

     output (mldsaSeed, tradKey)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-priv-key title="DeserializeKey(bytes) -> (mlkemSeed, tradKey)"}



## SerializeCiphertextValue and DeSerializeCiphertextValue

The serialization routine for the CompositeCiphertextValue simply concatenates the fixed-length
ML-KEM ciphertext with the ciphertext from the traditional algorithm, as defined below:

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.SerializeCiphertext(mldsaCT, tradCT) -> bytes

Explicit Inputs:

  mlkemCT  The ML-KEM ciphertext, which is bytes.

  tradCT   The traditional ciphertext in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Output:

  bytes   The encoded CompositeSignatureValue

Serialization Process:

  1. Combine and output the encoded composite signature

     output mlkemCT || tradEncodedSignature

~~~
{: #alg-composite-serialize-ct title="SerializeCiphertext(mldsaCT, tradCT) -> bytes"}


Deserialization reverses this process, raising an error in the event that the input is malformed.

~~~
Composite-ML-KEM.DeserializeCiphertext(bytes) -> (mldkemCT, tradCT)

Explicit Input:

  bytes   An encoded CompositeCiphertextValue

Implicit inputs:

  ML-KEM   A placeholder for the specific ML-KEM algorithm and
           parameter set to use, for example, could be "ML-KEM-768".

Output:

  mlkemCT  The ML-KEM ciphertext, which is bytes.

  tradCT   The traditional ciphertext in the appropriate
            encoding for the underlying component algorithm.

Deserialization Process:

  1. Parse each constituent encoded ciphertext.
       The length of the mlkemCT is known based on the size of
       the ML-KEM component signature length specified by the Object ID

     switch ML-KEM do
        case ML-KEM-768:
          mlkemCT = bytes[:1088]
          tradSig  = bytes[1088:]
        case ML-KEM-1024:
          mldsaSig = bytes[:1568]
          tradSig  = bytes[1568:]

     Note that while ML-KEM has fixed-length ciphectexts, RSA and ECDSA
     may not, depending on encoding, so rigorous length-checking is
     not always possible here.

  2. Output the component signature values

     output (mlkemCT, tradCT)
~~~
{: #alg-composite-deserialize-ct title="DeserializeCiphertext(bytes) -> (mldkemCT, tradCT)"}




# Composite Key Structures {#sec-composite-keys}

In order to form composite public keys and ciphertext values, we define ASN.1-based composite encodings such that these structures can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing public key and ciphertext fields such as those found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652].

## CompositeKEMPublicKey {#sec-composite-pub-keys}

The wire encoding of a Composite ML-KEM public key is:

~~~ ASN.1
CompositeKEMPublicKey ::= BIT STRING
~~~
{: artwork-name="CompositeKEMPublicKey-asn.1-structures"}

Since RSA and ECDH component public keys are themselves in a DER encoding, the following show the internal structure of the various public key types used in this specification:

When a CompositeKEMPublicKey is used with an RSA public key, the BIT STRING itself is generated by the concatenation of a raw ML-KEM key according to {{I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}} and an RSAPublicKey (which is a DER encoded RSAPublicKey).

When a CompositeKEMPublicKey is used with an EC public key, the BIT STRING itself is generated by the concatenation of a raw ML-KEM key according to {{I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}} and an ECDHPublicKey (which is a DER encoded ECPoint).

When a CompositeKEMPublicKey is used with an Edwards public key, the BIT STRING itself is generated by the concatenation of a raw ML-KEM key according to {{I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates}} and a raw Edwards public key according to [RFC8410].

Some applications may need to reconstruct the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` objects corresponding to each component public key. {{tab-kem-algs}} in {{sec-alg-ids}} provides the necessary mapping between composite and their component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.

When the CompositeKEMPublicKey must be provided in octet string or bit string format, the data structure is encoded as specified in {{sec-encoding-rules}}.

In order to maintain security properties of the composite, applications that use composite keys MUST always perform fresh key generations of both component keys and MUST NOT reuse existing key material. See {{sec-cons-key-reuse}} for a discussion.

The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is defined to allow for compact definitions of each composite algorithm, leading to a smaller overall ASN.1 module.

~~~ ASN.1
  pk-CompositeKEM {OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, PublicKeyType}
    PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
      IDENTIFIER id
      KEY PublicKeyType
      PARAMS ARE absent
      CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
    }
~~~
{: artwork-name="CompositeKeyObject-asn.1-structures"}


As an example, the public key type `pk-MLKEM768-ECDH-P384` can be defined compactly as:

~~~
pk-MLKEM768-ECDH-P384 PUBLIC-KEY ::=
  pk-CompositeKEM {
    id-MLKEM768-ECDH-P384-HKDF-SHA256,
    EcCompositeKemPublicKey }
~~~

The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found in the ASN.1 Module in {{sec-asn1-module}}.


## CompositeKEMPrivateKey {#sec-priv-key}

When a Composite ML-KEM private key is to be exported from a cryptographic module, it uses an analogous definition to the public keys:

~~~ ASN.1
CompositeKEMPrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
~~~
{: artwork-name="CompositeKEMPrivateKey-asn.1-structures"}

Each element of the `CompositeKEMPrivateKey` Sequence is an `OCTET STRING` according to the encoding of the underlying algorithm specification and will decode into the respective private key structures in an analogous way to the public key structures defined in {{sec-composite-pub-keys}}. This document does not provide helper classes for private keys.  The PrivateKey for each component algorithm MUST be in the same order as defined in {{sec-composite-pub-keys}}.

Use cases that require an interoperable encoding for composite private keys will often need to place a `CompositeKEMPrivateKey` inside a `OneAsymmetricKey` structure defined in [RFC5958], such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12 [RFC7292], CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211]. The definition of `OneAsymmetricKey` is copied here for convenience:

~~~ ASN.1
 OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
       version                   Version,
       privateKeyAlgorithm       PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
       privateKey                PrivateKey,
       attributes            [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
       ...,
       [[2: publicKey        [1] PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
       ...
     }

  ...
  PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING
                        -- Content varies based on type of key.  The
                        -- algorithm identifier dictates the format of
                        -- the key.
~~~
{: artwork-name="RFC5958-OneAsymmetricKey-asn.1-structure"}

When a `CompositeKEMPrivateKey` is conveyed inside a OneAsymmetricKey structure (version 1 of which is also known as PrivateKeyInfo) [RFC5958], the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set to the corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according to {{sec-alg-ids}} and its parameters field MUST be absent.  The privateKey field SHALL contain the `CompositeKEMPrivateKey`, and the `publicKey` field remains OPTIONAL.  If the `publicKey` field is present, it MUST be a `CompositeKEMPublicKey`.

Some applications may need to reconstruct the `OneAsymmetricKey` objects corresponding to each component private key. {{sec-alg-ids}} provides the necessary mapping between composite and their component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.

Component keys of a CompositeKEMPrivateKey MUST NOT be used in any other type of key or as a standalone key. For more details on the security considerations around key reuse, see {{sec-cons-key-reuse}}.


## Key Usage Bits

When any of the Composite ML-KEM `AlgorithmIdentifier` appears in the `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` field of an X.509 certificate [RFC5280], the key usage certificate extension MUST only contain

~~~
keyEncipherment
~~~

Composite ML-KEM keys MUST NOT be used in a "dual usage" mode because even if the
traditional component key supports both signing and encryption,
the post-quantum algorithms do not and therefore the overall composite algorithm does not.


# Composite ML-KEM Structures

## kema-CompositeKEM {#sec-kema-CompositeKEM}

The ASN.1 algorithm object for a Composite ML-KEM is:

~~~
kema-CompositeKEM {
  OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
    PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
    KEM-ALGORITHM ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id
         VALUE CompositeCiphertextValue
         PARAMS ARE absent
         PUBLIC-KEYS { publicKeyType }
        }
~~~

## CompositeCiphertextValue {#sec-CompositeCiphertextValue}

The `CompositeCipherTextValue` is the DER encoding of a SEQUENCE of the ciphertexts from the
underlying component algorithms.  It is represented in ASN.1 as follows:

~~~
CompositeCiphertextValue ::= OCTET STRING
~~~

The order of the component ciphertexts is the same as the order defined in {{sec-composite-pub-keys}}.

Note that in alignment with ML-KEM which outputs a 256-bit shared secret key at all security levels, all Composite KEM algorithms output a 256-bit shared secret key.

For the use of HKDF [RFC5869]: a salt is not provided; i.e. the default salt (all zeroes of length HashLen) will be used. For HKDF-SHA256 the output of 256 bit output is used directly; for HKDF-SHA384/256, HKDF is invoked with SHA384 and then the output is truncated to 256 bits, meaning that only the first 256 bits of output are used.

## Domain Separators {#sec-domsep-values}

The KEM combiner used in this document requires a domain separator `Domain` input.  The following table shows the HEX-encoded domain separator for each Composite ML-KEM AlgorithmID; to use it, the value MUST be HEX-decoded and used in binary form. The domain separator is simply the DER encoding of the composite algorithm OID.

## Rationale for choices

In generating the list of Composite algorithms, the following general guidance was used, however, during development of this specification several algorithms were added by direct request even though they do not fit this guidance.

* Pair equivalent security levels between
* NIST-P-384 is CNSA approved [CNSA2.0] for all classification levels.
* 521 bit curve not widely used.
* SHA256 and SHA512 generally have better adoption than SHA384.

A single invocation of SHA3 is known to behave as a dual-PRF, and thus is sufficient for use as a KDF, see {{sec-cons-kem-combiner}}, however SHA2 is not so must be wrapped in the HKDF construction.

The lower security levels (i.e. ML-KEM768) are provided with HKDF-SHA2 as the KDF in order to facilitate implementations that do not have easy access to SHA3 outside of the ML-KEM function. Higher security levels (i.e. ML-KEM1024) are paired with SHA3 for computational efficiency except for one variant paired with HKDF-SHA384 for compliance with [CNSA2.0], and the Edwards Curve (X25519 and X448) combinations are paired with SHA3 for compatibility with other similar specifications.

While it may seem odd to use 256-bit hash functions at all security levels, this aligns with ML-KEM which produces a 256-bit shared secret key at all security levels. SHA-256 and SHA3-256 both have >= 256 bits of (2nd) pre-image resistance, which is the required property for a KDF to provide 128 bits of security, as allowed in Table 3 of {{SP.800-57pt1r5}}.

## RSA-OAEP Parameters {#sect-rsaoaep-params}

Use of RSA-OAEP [RFC8017] within `id-MLKEM768-RSA2048-HKDF-SHA256`, `id-MLKEM768-RSA3072-HKDF-SHA256`, and `id-MLKEM768-RSA4096-HKDF-SHA256` requires additional specification.

First, a quick note on the choice of RSA-OAEP as the supported RSA encryption primitive. RSA-KEM [RFC5990] is more straightforward to work with, but it has fairly limited adoption and therefore is of limited backwards compatibility value. Also, while RSA-PKCS#1v1.5 [RFC8017] is still everywhere, but hard to make secure and no longer FIPS-approved as of the end of 2023 [SP800-131Ar2], so it is of limited forwards value. This leaves RSA-OAEP [RFC8017] as the remaining choice.

The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit and 3072-bit security levels respectively.

As with the other Composite ML-KEM algorithms, when `id-MLKEM768-RSA2048-HKDF-SHA256`, `id-MLKEM768-RSA3072-HKDF-SHA256`, or `id-MLKEM-RSA4096` is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters MUST be absent. The RSA-OAEP SHALL be instantiated with the following hard-coded parameters which are the same for the 2048, 3072 and 4096 bit security levels.

| RSAES-OAEP-params           | Value                       |
| ----------------------      | ---------------             |
| hashAlgorithm               | id-sha256                 |
| maskGenAlgorithm            | mgf1SHA256Identifier        |
| pSourceAlgorithm            | pSpecifiedEmpty             |
| ss_len                      | 256 bits                    |
{: #rsa-oaep-params title="RSA-OAEP Parameters"}

where:

* `id-sha256` is defined in [RFC8017].
* `mgf1SHA256Identifier` is defined in [RFC4055], which refers to the MFG1 function defined in [RFC8017] appendix B.2.1.
* `pSpecifiedEmpty` is defined in [RFC8017] to indicate that the empty string is used for the label.

Note: The mask length, according to [RFC8017], is `k - hLen - 1`, where `k` is the size of the RSA modulus. Since the choice of hash function and the RSA key size is fixed for each composite algorithm, implementations could choose to pre-compute and hard-code the mask length.

# Security Considerations

## Why Hybrids?

In broad terms, a PQ/T Hybrid can be used either to provide dual-algorithm security or to provide migration flexibility. Let's quickly explore both.

Dual-algorithm security. The general idea is that the data is proctected by two algorithms such that an attacker would need to break both in order to compromise the data. As with most of cryptography, this property is easy to state in general terms, but becomes more complicated when expressed in formalisms. The following sections go into more detail here.

Migration flexibility. Some PQ/T hybrids exist to provide a sort of "OR" mode where the client can choose to use one algorithm or the other or both. The intention is that the PQ/T hybrid mechanism builds in backwards compatibility to allow legacy and upgraded clients to co-exist and communicate. The Composites presented in this specification do not provide this since they operate in a strict "AND" mode, but they do provide codebase migration flexibility. Consider that an organization has today a mature, validated, certified, hardened implementation of RSA or ECC. Composites allow them to add to this an ML-KEM implementation which immediately starts providing benefits against harvest-now-decrypt-later attacks even if that ML-KEM implemtation is still experimental, non-validated, non-certified, non-hardened implementation. More details of obtaining FIPS certification of a composite algorithm can be found in {{sec-fips}}.

## KEM Combiner {#sec-cons-kem-combiner}

The following KEM combiner construction is as follows is used by both `Composite-ML-KEM.Encap()` and `Composite-ML-KEM.Decap()` and is split out here for easier analysis.

~~~
  KDF(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
~~~
{: #code-generic-kem-combiner title="KEM combiner construction"}

where:

* `KDF(message)` represents a key derivation function suitable to the chosen KEMs according to {{tab-kem-algs}}. All KDFs produce a 256-bit shared secret key, which matches ML-KEM.
* `mlkemSS` is the shared secret key from the ML-KEM component.
* `tradSS` is the shared secret from the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `tradCT` is the ciphertext from the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `tradPK` is the public key of the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA).
* `Domain` is the DER encoded value of the object identifier of the Composite ML-KEM algorithm as listed in {{sec-domsep-values}}.
* `||` represents concatenation.

Each registered Composite ML-KEM algorithm specifies the choice of `KDF` and `Domain` to be used in {{sec-alg-ids}} and {{sec-domsep-values}} below. Given that each Composite ML-KEM algorithm fully specifies the component algorithms, including for example the size of the RSA modulus, all inputs to the KEM combiner are fixed-size and thus do not require length-prefixing. The `CompositeKEM.Decap()` specified in {{sect-composite-decaps}} adds further error handling to protect the KEM combiner from malicious inputs.

The primary security property of the KEM combiner is that it preserves IND-CCA2 of the overall Composite ML-KEM so long as at least one component is IND-CCA2 {X-Wing} [GHP18]. Additionally, we also need to consider the case where one of the component algorithms is completely broken; that the private key is known to an attacker, or worse that the public key, private key, and ciphertext are manipulated by the attacker. In this case, we rely on the construction of the KEM combiner to ensure that the value of the other shared secret cannot be leaked or the combined shared secret predicted via manipulation of the broken algorithm. The following sections continue this discussion.

Note that length-tagging of the inputs to the KDF is not required:

* `mlkemSS` is always 32 bytes.
* `tradSS` in the case of ECDH this is derived by the decapsulator and therefore the length is not controlled by the attacker, however in the case of RSA-OAEP this value is directly chosen by the sender and both the length and content could be freely chosen by an attacker.
* `tradCT` is either an elliptic curve public key or an RSA-OAEP ciphertext which is required to have its length checked by step 1b of RSAES-OAEP-DECRYPT in [RFC8017].
* `tradPK` is the public key of the traditional component (elliptic curve or RSA) and therefore fixed-length.
* `Domain` is a fixed value specified in this document.

In the case of a composite with ECDH, all inputs to the KDF are fixed-length.
In the case of a composite with RSA-OAEP the `tradSS` is controlled by the attacker but this still does not require length tagging because, unless there is a weakness in the KDF, length-manipulation of only one input is not sufficient to trivially produce collisions.

### Security of the hybrid scheme

Informally, a Composite ML-KEM algorithm is secure if the combiner (HKDF-SHA2 or SHA3) is secure, and either ML-KEM is secure or the traditional component (RSA-OAEP, ECDH, or X25519) is secure.

The security of ML-KEM and ECDH hybrids is covered in [X-Wing] and requires that the first KEM component (ML-KEM in this construction) is IND-CCA and second ciphertext preimage resistant (C2PRI) and that the second traditional component is IND-CCA. This design choice improves performance by not including the large ML-KEM public key and ciphertext, but means that an implementation error in the ML-KEM component that affects the ciphertext check step of the FO transform could result in the overall composite no longer achieving IND-CCA2 security.

The QSF framework presented in [X-Wing] is extended to cover RSA-OAEP as the traditional algorithm in place of ECDH by noting that RSA-OAEP is also IND-CCA secure [RFC8017].

Note that X-Wing uses SHA3 as the combiner KDF whereas Composite ML-KEM uses either SHA3 or HKDF-SHA2 which are interchangeable in the X-Wing proof since both behave as random oracles under multiple concatenated inputs.

The Composite combiner cannot be assumed to be secure when used with different KEMs and a more cautious approach would bind the public key and ciphertext of the first KEM as well.


### Second pre-image resistance of component KEMs {#sec-cons-ct-collision}

The notion of a second pre-image resistant KEM is defined in [X-Wing] being the property that it is computationally difficult to find two different ciphertexts `c != c'` that will decapsulate to the same shared secret under the same public key. For the purposes of a hybrid KEM combiner, this property means that given two composite ciphertexts `(c1, c2)` and `(c1', c2')`, we must obtain a unique overall shared secret so long as either `c1 != c1'` or `c2 != c2'` -- i.e. the overall Composite ML-KEM is second pre-image resistant, and therefore secure so long as one of the component KEMs is secure.

In [X-Wing] it is proven that ML-KEM is a second pre-image resistant KEM and therefore the ML-KEM ciphertext can safely be omitted from the KEM combiner. Note that this makes a fundamental assumption on ML-KEM remaining ciphertext second pre-image resistant, and therefore this formulation of KEM combiner does not fully protect against implementation errors in the ML-KEM component -- particularly around the ciphertext check step of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform -- which could trivially lead to second ciphertext pre-image attacks that break the IND-CCA2 security of the ML-KEM component and of the overall Composite ML-KEM. This could be more fully mitigated by binding the ML-KEM ciphertext in the combiner, but a design decision was made to settle for protection against algorithmic attacks and not implementation attacks against ML-KEM in order to increase performance.

However, since neither RSA-OAEP nor ECDH guarantee second pre-image resistance at all, even in a correct implementation, these ciphertexts are bound to the key derivation in order to guarantee that `c != c'` will yield a unique ciphertext, and thus restoring second pre-image resistance to the overall Composite ML-KEM.

### SHA3 vs HKDF-SHA2

In order to achieve the desired security property that the Composite ML-KEM is IND-CCA2 whenever at least one of the component KEMs is, the KDF used in the KEM combiner needs to possess collision and second pre-image resistance with respect to each of its inputs independently; a property sometimes called "dual-PRF" [Aviram22]. Collision and second-pre-image resistance protects against compromise of one component algorithm from resulting in the ability to construct multiple different ciphertexts which result in the same shared secret. Pre-image resistance protects against compromise of one component algorithm being used to attack and learn the value of the other shared secret.

SHA3 is known to have all of the necessary dual-PRF properties [X-Wing], but SHA2 does not and therefore all SHA2-based constructions MUST use SHA2 within an HMAC construction such as HKDF-SHA2 [GHP18].

### Generifying this construction

It should be clear that the security analysis of the presented KEM combiner construction relies heavily on the specific choices of component algorithms and combiner KDF, and this combiner construction SHOULD NOT by applied to any other combination of ciphers without performing the appropriate security analysis.

## Key Reuse {#sec-cons-key-reuse}

When using single-algorithm cryptography, the best practice is to always generate fresh keying material for each purpose, for example when renewing a certificate, or obtaining both a TLS and S/MIME certificate for the same device, however in practice key reuse in such scenarios is not always catastrophic to security and therefore often tolerated. With composite keys we have a much stricter security requirement. However this reasoning does not hold in the PQ / Traditional hybrid setting.

Within the broader context of PQ / Traditional hybrids, we need to consider new attack surfaces that arise due to the hybrid constructions and did not exist in single-algorithm contexts. One of these is key reuse where the component keys within a hybrid are also used by themselves within a single-algorithm context. For example, it might be tempting for an operator to take already-deployed RSA keys and add an ML-KEM key to them to form a hybrid. Within a hybrid signature context this leads to a class of attacks referred to as "stripping attacks" where one component signature can be extracted and presented as a single-algorithm signature. Hybrid KEMs using a concatenation-style KEM combiner, as is done in this document, do not have the analogous attack surface because even if an attacker is able to extract and decrypt one of the component ciphertexts, this will yield a different shared secret than the overall shared secret derived from the composite, so any subsequent symmetric cryptographic operations will fail. However there is still a risk of key reuse which relates to certificate revocation, as well as general key reuse security issues.

Upon receiving a new certificate enrollment request, many certification authorities will check if the requested public key has been previously revoked due to key compromise. Often a CA will perform this check by using the public key hash. Therefore, even if both components of a composite have been previously revoked, the CA may only check the hash of the combined composite key and not find the revocations. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid key reuse and always generate fresh component keys for a new composite. It is also RECOMMENDED that CAs performing revocation checks on a composite key should also check both component keys independently.


## Decapsulation failure

Provided all inputs are well-formed, the key establishment procedure of ML-KEM will never explicitly fail. Specifically, the ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps algorithms from [FIPS.203] will always output a value with the same data type as a shared secret key, and will never output an error or failure symbol. However, it is possible (though extremely unlikely) that the process will fail in the sense that ML-KEM.Encaps and ML-KEM.Decaps will produce different outputs, even though both of them are behaving honestly and no adversarial interference is present. In this case, the sender and recipient clearly did not succeed in producing a shared secret key. This event is called a decapsulation failure. Estimates for the decapsulation failure probability (or rate) for each of the ML-KEM parameter sets are provided in Table 1  of [FIPS.203] and reproduced here in {{tab-mlkem-failure-rate}}.


| Parameter set     | Decapsulation failure rate  |
|---------          | -----------------           |
| ML-KEM-512        | 2^(-139)                    |
| ML-KEM-768        | 2^(-164)                    |
| ML-KEM-1024       | 2^(-174)                    |
{: #tab-mlkem-failure-rate title="ML-KEM decapsulation failure rates"}

In the case of ML-KEM decapsulation failure, Composite ML-KEM MUST preserve the same behaviour and return a well-formed output.


## Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

Traditionally, a public key or certificate contains a single cryptographic algorithm. If and when an algorithm becomes deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), the path to deprecating it and removing it from operational environments is, at least is principle, straightforward.

In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use. As such, a single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled independently from that of their component algorithms. For example a cryptographic policy might continue to allow `id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256` even after ECDH-P256 is deprecated.

The Composite ML-KEM design specified in this document, and especially that of the KEM combiner specified in this document, and discussed in {{sec-cons-kem-combiner}}, means that the overall Composite ML-KEM algorithm should be considered to have the security strength of the strongest of its component algorithms; i.e. as long as one component algorithm remains strong, then the overall composite algorithm remains strong.

# Implementation Considerations {#sec-in-pract}

## FIPS Certification {#sec-fips}

For reference, the KEM Combiner used in Composite KEM is:

```
ss = KDF(mlkemSS || tradSS || tradCT || tradPK || Domain)
```

where KDF is either SHA3 or HKDF-SHA2.


NIST SP 800-227 [SP-800-227ipd], which at the time of writing is in its initial public draft period, allows hybrid key combiners of the following form:

```
K ← KDM(S1‖S2‖ · · · ‖St , OtherInput)           (14)
```

The key derivation method KDM can take one of two forms, either

```
K ← KDF(Z‖OtherInput)                            (12)
```

or

```
K ← Expand(Extract(salt, Z), OtherInput)         (13)
```

The Composite KEM variants that use SHA3 as a combiner fit form (12) while the variants that use HKDF-SHA2 fit form (13).

In terms of the order of inputs, Composite KEM places the two shared secret keys `mlkemSS || tradSS` at the beggining of the KDF input such that all other inputs `tradCT || tradPK || Domain` can be considered part of `OtherInput` for the purposes of FIPS certification. [SP-800-227ipd] adds an important stipulation that was not present in earlier NIST specifications:

> This publication approves the use of the key combiner (14) for any t > 1, so long as at
> least one shared secret (i.e., S_j for some j) is a shared secret generated from the key-
> establishment methods of SP 800-56A or SP 800-56B, or an approved KEM.

This means that although Composite KEM always places the shared secret key from ML-KEM in the first slot, a Composite KEM can be FIPS certified so long as either component is FIPS certified. This is important for several reasons. First, in the early stages of PQC migration, composites allow for a non-FIPS certified ML-KEM implementation to be added to a module that already has a FIPS certified traditional component, and the resulting composite can be FIPS certified. Second, when eventually RSA and Elliptic Curve are no longer FIPS-allowed, the composite can retain its FIPS certified status on the strength of the ML-KEM component. Third, while this is outside the scope of this document, the general composite construction could be used to create FIPS certified algorithms that contain a component algorithm from a different jurisdiction.


### FIPS certification of Combiner Function

TODO: update this to NIST SP 800-227, once it is published.

One of the primary NIST documents which is relevant for certification of a composite algorithm is NIST SP.800-56Cr2 [SP.800-56Cr2] by using the allowed "hybrid" shared secret of the form `Z' = Z || T`. Compliance is achieved in the following way:

[SP.800-56Cr2] section 4 "One-Step Key Derivation" requires a `counter` which begins at the 4-byte value 0x00000001. However, the counter is allowed to be omitted when the hash function is executed only once, as specified on page 159 of the FIPS 140-3 Implementation Guidance [FIPS-140-3-IG].

The HKDF-SHA2 options can be certified under [SP.800-56Cr2] One-Step Key Derivation Option 2: `H(x) = HMAC-hash(salt, x)` where `salt` is the empty (0 octet) string, which will internally be mapped to the zero vector `0x00..00` of the correct input size for the underlying hash function in order to satisfy the requirement in [SP.800-56Cr2] that "in the absence of an agreed-upon alternative – the default_salt shall be an all-zero byte string whose bit length equals that specified as the bit length of an input block for the hash function, hash". Note that since the desired shared secret key output length of 256 bits for all security levels aligns with the block size of SHA256, we do not need to use the HKDF-Extract step specified in [RFC5869], which further simplifies FIPS certification by allowing us to use the One-Step KDF rather than the Two-Step KDF from [SP.800-56Cr2].

The SHA3 options can be certified under [SP.800-56Cr2] One-Step Key Derivation Option 1: `H(x) = hash(x)`.


## Backwards Compatibility {#sec-backwards-compat}

As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as providing ease of migration. The composite mechanisms defined in this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be obtained.

The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades. The term "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can inter-operate with the upgraded systems of the future.

These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to key establishment and content encryption, from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME signed email [RFC8551], as well as myriad other standardized and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS [RFC5652] encrypted structures.

## Decapsulation Requires the Public Key {#impl-cons-decaps-pubkey}

ML-KEM always requires the public key in order to perform various steps of the Fujisaki-Okamoto decapsulation [FIPS.203], and for this reason the private key encoding specified in FIPS 203 includes the public key. Therefore it is not required to carry it in the `OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey` field, which remains optional, but is strictly speaking redundant since an ML-KEM public key can be parsed from an ML-KEM private key, and thus populating the `OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey` field would mean that two copies of the public key data are transmitted.


With regard to the traditional algorithms, RSA or Elliptic Curve, in order to achieve the public-key binding property the KEM combiner used to form the Composite ML-KEM, the combiner requires the traditional public key as input to the KDF that derives the output shared secret. Therefore it is required to carry the public key within the respective `OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey` as per the private key encoding given in {{sec-priv-key}}. Implementers who choose to use a different private key encoding than the one specified in this document MUST consider how to provide the component public keys to the decapsulate routine. While some implementations might contain routines to computationally derive the public key from the private key, it is not guaranteed that all implementations will support this; for this reason the interoperable composite private key format given in this document in {{sec-priv-key}} requires the public key of the traditional component to be included.

# Comparison with other Hybrid KEMs

## X-Wing

This specification borrows extensively from the analysis and KEM combiner construction presented in [X-Wing]. In particular, X-Wing and id-MLKEM768-X25519-SHA3-256 are largely interchangeable. The one difference is that X-Wing uses a combined KeyGen function to generate the two component private keys from the same seed, which gives some additional binding properies. However, using a derived value as the seed for ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal() is, at time of writing, explicitely disallowed by [FIPS.203] which makes it impossible to create a FIPS-compliant implentation of X-Wing KeyGen / private key import. For this reason, this specification keeps the key generatation for both components separate so that implementers are free to use an existing certified hardware or software module for one or both components.

Due to the difference in key generation and security properties, X-Wing and id-MLKEM768-X25519-SHA3-256 have been registered as separate algorithms with separate OIDs, and they use a different domain separator string in order to ensure that their ciphertexts are not inter-compatible.

## ETSI CatKDF

[ETSI.TS.103.744] section 8.2 defines CatKDF as:

~~~
1) Form secret = psk || k1 || k 2 || … || k n.
2) Set f_context = f(context, MA, MB), where f is a context formatting function.
3) key_material = KDF(secret, label, f_context, length).
4) Return key_material.

MA shall contain all of the public keys.
MB shall contain all of the corresponding public keys and ciphertexts.
~~~

The main difference between the Composite KEM combiner and the ETSI CatKDF combiner is that CatKDF makes the more conservative choice to bind the public keys and ciphertexts of both components, while Composite KEM follows the analysis presented in [X-Wing] that while preserving the security properties of the traditional component requires binding the public key and ciphertext of the traditional component, it is not necessary to do so for ML-KEM thanks to the rejection sampling step of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform.

Additionally, ETSI CatKDF uses HKDF [RFC5869] as the KDF which aligns with some of the variants in this specification, but not the ones that use SHA3.


# Test Vectors {#appdx-samples}

The following test vectors are provided in a format similar to the NIST ACVP Known-Answer-Tests (KATs).

The structure is that a global `cacert` is provided which is used to sign each KEM certificate.
Within each test case there are the following values:

* `tcId` the name of the algorithm.
* `ek` the encapsulation public key.
* `x5c` the X.509 certificate of the encapsulation key, signed by the cacert.
* `dk` the raw decapsulation private key.
* `dk_pkcs8` the decapsulation private key in a PKCS#8 object.
* `c` the ciphertext.
* `k` the derived shared secret key.

Implementers should be able to perform the following tests using the test vectors below:

1. Load the public key `ek` or certificate `x5c` and perform an encapsulation for it.
2. Load the decapsulation private key `dk` and the ciphertext `c` and ensure that the same shared secret key `k` can be derived.

Test vectors are provided for each underlying component in isolation for the purposes of debugging.


Due to the length of the test vectors, you may prefer to retrieve them from GitHub. The reference implementation that generated them is also available:
